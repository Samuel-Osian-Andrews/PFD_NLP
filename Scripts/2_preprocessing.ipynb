In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:­ (1) No assessment of the risk of suicide or self-harm upon release took place during the Deceased's time in detention (2) There was a lack of clear communication to the Police as to what, if any assessment had taken place. (3) The conversation between the Practitioner and the Deceased took place through an observation hatch in circumstances where no risk was posed to the Practitioner from being in the same room as the Deceased. This was not best practice. (4) The terminology used by the Practitioner was misleading in that it suggested that there was no role for the liaison and Diversion service because no unmet needs or vulnerabilities had been identified. The evidence was that the Deceased had declined consent for an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities and therefore the notes should have made clear that an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities had not taken place. (5) The 'review' undertaken by a Health & Justice Operational Manager of the West Mercia Health & Justice Service consisted of duplication of the Practitioners statement with no comment, observations or identification of areas of learning.

      "ORIGINAL TEXT: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as ‘Nightingales’) Whereas the court heard evidence that Nightingales would not accept another patient with an equivalent medical profile/history and that, should a resident within one of Nightingales’ homes require access to items to be restricted, they would be given 1:1 support pending a mental health assessment and discharge to a more appropriate facility, it was not possible for the home concerned to advise the court as to how and by whom the lead in question had been returned to Mrs Stringer. The concern arises that, in the case of a resident whose care requires access to items to be restricted, there should be a fail- safe, documented system, known to and implemented by staff, by which access to those items by the resident is prevented. In the circumstances that the possibility of a resident requiring such care may still arise, this concern exists notwithstanding the decisions now made. 2) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as ‘Nightingales’) The court heard evidence as to the potential detrimental effects of isolation and loneliness in the elderly, including evidence from the court appointed expert that isolation can be very corrosive, that it is the single most potent causative risk factor for depression in the elderly and that it can have a very detrimental effect on a person’s mental state. There is a need for this to be known amongst staff. The concern arises as one member of staff gave (disputed) evidence that they had little or no training in such matters. 3) (Addressed to Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire County Council, Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited (the latter referred to collectively as ‘Nightingales’)) The court heard evidence and/or found that a number of steps had not been taken pertaining to the transfer of information concerning Mrs Stringer’s risk of suicide. They included the following: i. The care coordinator should have requested that the acute hospital make a referral to the Mental Health Liaison Team for a review; ii. It would have been good practice for a further professionals meeting / CPA review to have taken place prior to formal discharge and no later than just after discharge to Nightingales and for the family to have been invited, to ensure that everyone was aware of the plan, that the family was aware of Mrs Stringer’s legal status and to discuss next steps in terms of liaison with other services; iii. There should have been greater professional curiosity and better communication at the time of transfer; iv. The Harbour mental health hospital’s RNNA should have been reviewed to determine whether it needed to be updated and it should have been updated if there was any different clinical information. Further self harm or suicidal ideation, if seen to be significant, should have given rise to a further RNNA; v. There had, in fact, been further indications of self harm and suicidal ideation and, in any event, of a wish to die, on 30th June 2020, in August 2020 and on 3rd September 2020 which were significant and should have been addressed in the information provided to Nightingales and had not been; vi. Mrs Stringer was discharged from The Harbour mental health hospital without an up-to-date Care Act Assessment and, in any event, taking into account the need for Mrs Stringer to be transferred to the acute hospital (which had been necessary), an up-to-date Care Act Assessment had not been completed during the period of her admission to the latter hospital; vii. The risk assessment should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; viii. A positive behaviour support plan should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; ix. A care plan, compliant with CPA Policy and Procedures Key Standard 10, which should have identified a suitable environment in which to manage Mrs Stringer’s risk, her needs and mental health and crisis and contingency planning, to cater for the event of a significant relapse in her mental health, should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; x. Risk behaviour should have been identified to Nightingales and context given, whereas that had not been the case in respect of certain behaviour, including the incident on 30th June 2020; xi. The care coordinator should have been better informed at the points of transfer and discharge; xii. There should have been more robust follow up by the care coordinator whilst Mrs Stringer was at the acute hospital; xiii. There had been no mental health service involvement between the 7-day follow up and 28th September 2020 or, if there had, it had not been recorded; xiv. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible for a manager to carry out a face-to-face assessment in the mental health hospital but no equivalent measure had been implemented; xv) Whereas it would have been helpful for Nightingales to have received the Continuing Healthcare Checklist, it had not been provided; xvi) Nightingales would have wished to see the risk of suicide referred to in the “Risks to the Service User” section of the FACE Overview Assessment; xvii) The court appointed expert had concerns about the accessibility of key information in the FACE Overview Assessment given the format of that document. Whereas the court heard evidence concerning subsequent, significant, purposeful, developments in practice, the matters listed above can be condensed into a single concern that there should be a comprehensive, cohesive, frictionless system for the timely collation (including from the family and/or other carers) and timely communication / transfer of sufficient, accessible information ((not, simply, risk assessments) pertaining to suicide risk in patients / service users / residents, by and between each of the service providers concerned.\n",

      "ORIGINAL TEXT: During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the inquest it came to light that John was prescribed medications for depression and epilepsy whilst incarcerated. His compliance with medications was found to be sporadic and as a result he failed to collect a number of prescriptions to enable continuity of his medication. Some of the reasons around this were anxiety in attending to collect his medications and also periods of self-isolation. Whilst Healthcare at the prison were aware of some of the periods of non-compliance and in fact a GP referral and action was taken to enable John to have weekly in-possession medication to support his compliance, other periods were not flagged or identified and it became clear that monitoring those prisoners who are not medication compliant, particularly if receiving weekly or monthly medication was challenging due to the SystmOne electronic patient system not being able to flag a warning for non-compliant prisoners for early identification and referral. John subsequently suffered a decline in his mental health and whilst the lack of medication compliance was not deemed to cause or contribute to his death, the importance of consistent medication for medical conditions and early identification of prisoners who do not comply was an issue which was raised and explored within the inquest. The action taken by the prison after John's suicide was to put a cross check system in place by which pharmacy technicians cross reference the medication by way of a weekly stock check to identify the prisoners who have not collected medications or had the same dispensed, so that referrals can be made to the Healthcare team and or GP to task. Such a system is less than ideal as it is both resource heavy, carries real risks of not being accurate and in the Coroners view, for prisoners in possession of medication, there is likely to be a much longer period before non-compliance is identified which carries real risks of fatalities. The inquest touched upon the SystmOne electronic record used across the Prison estates by Healthcare. From the evidence it appears that the system has a facility to flag concerns and tasks to action and in fact, certain flags are generated automatically to alert healthcare staff to live issues around a prisoner, however, something as simple and the system generating a warning flag to identify when medication is not dispensed or collected was neither possible nor available on the current operating system. An automated flag alert via the system upon the failure to dispense or collect medication by a prisoner would be a far more efficient and effective way in which prisoners failing to comply with medications could be identified and actioned quickly and in which future deaths could be prevented.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health’s Guidance for Commissioners of Community Specialist Mental Health Services expresses an expectation that there would be more than one clinical psychologist for each Community Mental Health Team, given that clinical psychologists are referred to in the plural within discussions of an appropriate staff team for CMHTs whereas, for example, consultant psychiatrists are referred to in the singular.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – a) During the evidence there was some confusion amongst staff as to what was required of them when carrying out observations patients in their rooms. There were different practices adopted by different staff and there appeared to be a custom of not enteriing a patient’s room on the hourly observations so as not to disturb the patients. Sadly because of this practice it was unclear when Christopher had last been seen alive. Whilst the Trust has indicated that all staff have received further training in respect of this I am still not convinved that it is clear as to what is required by staff. b) Following the evidence the Jury concluded:- (a) that during Christopher’s time at Langley Green Hospital no formal review, care plan or adequate risk assessment was carried out in respect of his mental health. (b) that the nursing and clinical records were not kept in accordance with the trust health and record policy. (c) that here was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement has taken place during the period of Christopher’s short stay. Whilst the Trust have indicated that there has been a review of the professional conduct of all staff involved in this case this does not allay my concerns that these practices are limited to just those staff involved in this case. c) Failure to provide staff to accompany a sectioned patient to the emergency department of another Hosptial for treatment for a physical condition. Requesting family member to undertake this role puts the patient and/or the family at risk\n",
      "CLEANED TEXT: a) During the evidence, there was confusion amongst staff regarding their responsibilities when observing patients in their rooms. Different practices were observed among staff members, including a custom of not entering a patient's room during hourly observations to avoid disturbing them. This practice led to uncertainty regarding the last time Christopher was seen alive.

      "b) Following the evidence, the Jury concluded that during Christopher's stay at Langley Green Hospital, no formal review had been conducted.are plan or adequate risk assessment was carried out in respect of his mental health. (b) that the nursing and clinical records were not kept in accordance with the trust health and record policy. (c) that here was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement has taken place during the period of Christopher’s short stay. Whilst the Trust have indicated that there has been a review of the professional conduct of all staff involved in this case this does not allay my concerns that these practices are limited to just those staff involved in this case. c) Failure to provide staff to accompany a sectioned patient to the emergency department of another Hosptial for treatment for a physical condition. Requesting family member to undertake this role puts the patient and/or the family at risk\n",

      "ORIGINAL TEXT: During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that no member of the team on Roman Ward contacted Fallon’s social worker. There was no protocol for this. If they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would have discovered that Fallon’s mum was not dead as Fallon had told them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was never made. It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon discharge. This might be very important for another patient.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – During the course of the inquest evidence was heard from a number of witnesses of the supervision and staffing arrangements within SACU. The overall position was that there was no supervising officer present on a day to day basis to ensure key tasks were always allocated or completed, and officers, including officers not posted to the SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various tasks between themselves on an adhoc basis. On the 2nd September 2019 the document setting out which hourly checks had been undertaken in the SACU was incomplete. No check on Mr Todd’s cell took place at 3pm that day. Evidence was heard that staffing levels can vary, with officers being occupied on tasks which meant hourly checks could not always be completed. Whilst there is auditing of the hourly checks retrospectively, there is no ‘real time’ system which would alert officers and their supervisors to checks being incomplete for a prisoner/s as the record of checks are paper based and held in the SACU, as well there is no constant supervising officer present or other system there to ensure compliance.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering “traffic duties” on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge. This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them. It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant 3 knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult. (2) While the “Right Care/Right Person” process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support. (3) I am aware that there is a Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide . I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role. (4) I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday – this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzie’s family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have “there is so much responsibility on someone’s head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or not”. I feel that these people should be given a specific set training plan to help them do what is a vital and important role.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Metropolitan Police Service officers attended Ms Marchessou on 8 July 2020, after she had been knocked over by the bus. 1. One of the police officers interviewed the bus driver, who told him that Ms Marchessou had stopped when the bus driver sounded his horn, but then had stepped straight in front of the bus, and after she had been hit had got up and run in front of another bus, only being saved when a passer-by grabbed hold of her. The police officer did not pass on this crucial account to the emergency ambulance crew who transported Ms Marchessou to hospital, nor to any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital. 2. Ms Marchessou told the police officers that she had blacked out and could not remember what had happened, then that she thought she had stepped into the road as the result of a panic attack. She also said that she had stepped in front of the bus because she was upset about being denied contact with her children. The police officers did not pass on the crucial information that Ms Marchessou said she had stepped in front of the bus because she was upset about being denied contact with her children, either to the emergency ambulance crew or to the treating doctors or nurses. 3. The two police officers waited with Ms Marchessou at the hospital for well over two hours, but did not at any point during that time radio police control to ask for any enquiries or searches of police systems to be made. Such information could have been potentially extremely helpful to those treating Ms Marchessou. 4. When the police officers returned to the police station, they did make a search themselves and discovered that she had been arrested for domestic violence. However, they did not make a Merlin record of her potential vulnerability and need for assistance. 3 5. I was provided with a statement from one of the two police officers in advance of the inquest and I called him to give oral evidence on 25 November 2020. When I put to him the sub optimal nature of the way that he had dealt with the incident on 8 July 2020, he did not appear to have undertaken any reflection on this in the intervening four and a half months, nor in the witness box. If there was any error in not passing on information, he attributed this error to his colleague. He did not consider that he had failed to apply a healthy degree of scepticism to Ms Marchessou’s version of events, particularly in the light of the bus driver’s description. He reiterated the view he had formed on the day, that Agnès Marchessou being hit by a bus was purely an accident. The police officer defended all of his actions robustly. I could not see that he had learnt anything as a result of these events or that anything about his practice would change in the future. 6. The police officer giving evidence was aware of the view of the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) regarding the failure to create a Merlin, expressed in its report on the police handling of the incident on 8 July, but he seemed very confused about how that should work in practice. If he is confused, even after police have taken him through the DPS report, then other police officers may also be confused.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The gatekeeping assessment included a mental health state examination, where it was the clinical opinion of the mental health practitioner from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team, that Ms Morris required an inpatient hospital admission to a mental health ward as there was an immediate risk to her safety as she was found to be a high risk of walking in front of a car. Whilst Ms Morris agreed to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Emergency Department or to remain in the community whilst waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris had been informed that if she attended the Accident and Emergency Department, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris did not wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that Ms Morris would stay overnight with a family member, and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for Ms Morris to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep her safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts as there is a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds. I am therefore concerned that there is a risk of future deaths as it is not possible to access inpatient mental health beds at the time of clinical need.\n",

In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died. The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis. In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter’s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled. The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively. I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts. • This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line. • Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz’s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper. • When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance. 3 2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner’s officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because told my officer about it. • I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest. • I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest. • I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month. • I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest. • I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief. • Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August. This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased.\n",

In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully, and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter’s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled. The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively. I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts. • This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line. • Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz’s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper. • When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance. 3 2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner’s officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because told my officer about it. • I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest. • I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest. • I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month. • I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest. • I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief. • Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August. This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1. The inquest was told that Tobias had sought and had been referred for mental health support however due to the high demand and long waiting lists 2 he was still on a waiting list at the time of his death. The evidence before the inquest was that long delays were still an issue and were not restricted to Tameside but were part of a national picture of delays and long waiting lists for those seeking help with their mental health. 2. The inquest also heard evidence of the impact of homelessness and consequential vulnerability on a young person like Tobias and that the demands on Local Authorities meant that even where vulnerability was recognised there were not resources to offer sustained support and stable housing solutions. The evidence was that as a consequence young vulnerable people had to rely on homeless shelters where they were exposed to additional negative influences and as in Tobias’s case abuse due to their sexuality. 3. Evidence was also heard that a person who has to rely on a homeless shelter can then become uncontactable to public service providers as they have no address for contact which means they then have even less chance of accessing support. 4. The inquest was told that young adults who are homeless are often sexually exploited and that those who identify as LGBTQIA can be particularly vulnerable and that the underlying vulnerability and risk was not always appreciated by those dealing with young homeless people and that it could be mistaken by agencies as a lifestyle choice rather than what it actually was, i.e., exploitation by an older adult. 5. The evidence before the inquest was that where multiple agencies were involved it was fundamental that one agency/person took overall ownership/responsibility to ensure a coordinated and effective approach using regular MDTs to understand the information that all agencies had in their possession and to offer effective support.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The transfer and review of prisoners on an ACCT. I am concerned in relation to the ability of any Prison to close an ACCT, with the attendance of 2 individuals (a prison and health care staff), after a short period of time on a newly transferred inmate (i.e. to a new prison) before anyone has had the time to review and assess him or her. For ACCTs created on current inmates within an establishment, who are known to staff, I do not see that as an issue, they would already have an existing knowledge and relationship and indeed would have been the originator of the ACCT in any event. However, for new prisoners, who have arrived from another prison establishment with an open ACCT on their record, I consider the ability to remove that individual from the ACCT, within a short period of time, does raise issues in respect of the knowledge and understanding of that individual and the ability of various agencies, within the prison, to have had time to review and communicate between themselves, about that individual. The provision of in effect 2 ‘no’ answers by a prisoner, is a potentially easy way of coming off an ACCT, which is there for their support and well-being, and I would suggest, given to easy manipulation I raise the issue as to whether there should be, for example, a set review period (e.g. 7 days) which allows time for the support services to meet with and interview the transferred inmate, interact, and then make a decision about and with the newly transferred prisoner on the ACCT before such an ACCT is closed.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. I heard evidence that following a review in 2015 changes to the ACCT document and process were piloted in 10 establishments in 2019 and this included HMP Swansea. As a result a revised ACCT version 6 and accompanying policy guidance was issued. This revised guidance makes clear that an ACCT must be opened by any member of staff who receives information that indicates a prisoner may be currently at risk of self-harm or suicide and that this information may come from a prison escort. However, this requirement is not new. It was clear in my view from the HMP Swansea Suicide and Prevention Policy that was in place at the time of Khalid's death that a warning marker for suicide on a prison escort record ('PER') should result in the opening of an ACCT. The prison officer who saw Khalid first in reception gave evidence that he was an experienced prison officer with over 20 years-experience of working in prisons including 18 years at HMP Swansea. At the time when Khalid came into custody he was an ACCT assessor and remains in this role. He saw Khalid's PER which stated that Khalid had recently made threats to kill himself and was alleging mental health issues and he saw the NOEMIS transfer report which contained reference to historic ACCTs that Khalid had been on in custody and an act of cutting and ligaturing by Khalid 9 months before in December 2015. He did not open an ACCT but referred to the nurse who also did not open an ACCT. In his evidence the Prison Officer stated that if a prisoner came into custody now in 2022 with a warning on his PER stating that he has recently made threats to kill himself then this would not be enough to trigger the opening of an ACCT. This view is inconsistent with the mandatory revised ACCT policy quidance that I have set out above. This indicates that the system for trainina on 2 ACCT in HMP Swansea is inadequate. The Prison Officer could not recall whether his ACCT training was up to date. His training records show that he was ACCT trained in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014 and I am told there was training on the new ACCT document that is not recorded in the training records and a further up-skilling session with staff date not specified. I did hear that training was difficult during the Covid 19 pandemic in HMP Swansea, however, ACCT training is required to be carried out with much more frequency than the training provided to the officer on reception and staff should understand the warning markers that require an ACCT to be opened. I am concerned that unless prison officers are provided with frequent ACCT training which is kept up to date then there remains a risk of similar deaths occurring in the future in HMP Swansea. 2. I heard evidence from the nurse who saw Khalid on reception. This person is an experienced mental health nurse who is now a charge nurse on bank. The nurse told me that he still does at times work through the bank as a mental health nurse in HMP Swansea. At the time of Khalid's death the Nurse was the mental health nurse working on reception and he completed the first reception health screen for Khalid and he did not open an ACCT. It was unclear what documents the nurse had seen on reception for Khalid but he did not asked prison staff if he could see any documents. The Nurse gave evidence that even if he had known that there was a suicide warning marker on Khalid's prison escort record this would not have been enough combined with what Khalid said to him to open an ACCT, he relies on Khalid's presentation. Khalid had been assessed by a consultant psychiatrist as a significant risk to himself a matter of weeks before he was seen by the Nurse in reception. HMP Swansea prison staff and the Nurse were not aware of this information but even if the Nurse had known this information his evidence was that this would not necessarily have been enough for him to open an ACCT, he would consider presentation. The revised ACCT version 6 and accompanying policy guidance set out above makes clear that an ACCT must be opened by any member of staff who receives information that indicates a prisoner may be currently at risk of self-harm or suicide and that this information may come from a prison escort. The answers of the Nurse raise a concern around the level and adequacy of the training on ACCT. The Nurse stated that he has reflected on his practice but that he still places emphasis on what the prisoner says and how they present when considering whether to open an ACCT. I heard evidence that bank nurses were supervised in the prison but that training on ACCT remained the responsibility of HMP Swansea. I am concerned that a bank nurse may not receive access to ACCT training including at the required regularity and I am concerned that unless this happens there remains a risk of similar deaths occurring in the future in HMP Swansea\n",

Note that we would not have this issue for models such as BERTopic which use their own embeddings.\n",

Where this occurs, this is mostly due to spelling mistakes, specialised terminology, or acronyms. Embeddings vector must be identical in dimension to our word tokens. As a crude solution to OOV words - which our Word2Vec model cannot numerically represent - we assign these words the average of all scores contained within each respective report."
