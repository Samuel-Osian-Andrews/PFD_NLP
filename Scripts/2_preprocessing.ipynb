In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:­ (1) No assessment of the risk of suicide or self-harm upon release took place during the Deceased's time in detention (2) There was a lack of clear communication to the Police as to what, if any assessment had taken place. (3) The conversation between the Practitioner and the Deceased took place through an observation hatch in circumstances where no risk was posed to the Practitioner from being in the same room as the Deceased. This was not best practice. (4) The terminology used by the Practitioner was misleading in that it suggested that there was no role for the liaison and Diversion service because no unmet needs or vulnerabilities had been identified. The evidence was that the Deceased had declined consent for an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities and therefore the notes should have made clear that an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities had not taken place. (5) The 'review' undertaken by a Health & Justice Operational Manager of the West Mercia Health & Justice Service consisted of duplication of the Practitioners statement with no comment, observations or identification of areas of learning.

      "ORIGINAL TEXT: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as ‘Nightingales’) Whereas the court heard evidence that Nightingales would not accept another patient with an equivalent medical profile/history and that, should a resident within one of Nightingales’ homes require access to items to be restricted, they would be given 1:1 support pending a mental health assessment and discharge to a more appropriate facility, it was not possible for the home concerned to advise the court as to how and by whom the lead in question had been returned to Mrs Stringer. The concern arises that, in the case of a resident whose care requires access to items to be restricted, there should be a fail- safe, documented system, known to and implemented by staff, by which access to those items by the resident is prevented. In the circumstances that the possibility of a resident requiring such care may still arise, this concern exists notwithstanding the decisions now made. 2) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as ‘Nightingales’) The court heard evidence as to the potential detrimental effects of isolation and loneliness in the elderly, including evidence from the court appointed expert that isolation can be very corrosive, that it is the single most potent causative risk factor for depression in the elderly and that it can have a very detrimental effect on a person’s mental state. There is a need for this to be known amongst staff. The concern arises as one member of staff gave (disputed) evidence that they had little or no training in such matters. 3) (Addressed to Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire County Council, Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited (the latter referred to collectively as ‘Nightingales’)) The court heard evidence and/or found that a number of steps had not been taken pertaining to the transfer of information concerning Mrs Stringer’s risk of suicide. They included the following: i. The care coordinator should have requested that the acute hospital make a referral to the Mental Health Liaison Team for a review; ii. It would have been good practice for a further professionals meeting / CPA review to have taken place prior to formal discharge and no later than just after discharge to Nightingales and for the family to have been invited, to ensure that everyone was aware of the plan, that the family was aware of Mrs Stringer’s legal status and to discuss next steps in terms of liaison with other services; iii. There should have been greater professional curiosity and better communication at the time of transfer; iv. The Harbour mental health hospital’s RNNA should have been reviewed to determine whether it needed to be updated and it should have been updated if there was any different clinical information. Further self harm or suicidal ideation, if seen to be significant, should have given rise to a further RNNA; v. There had, in fact, been further indications of self harm and suicidal ideation and, in any event, of a wish to die, on 30th June 2020, in August 2020 and on 3rd September 2020 which were significant and should have been addressed in the information provided to Nightingales and had not been; vi. Mrs Stringer was discharged from The Harbour mental health hospital without an up-to-date Care Act Assessment and, in any event, taking into account the need for Mrs Stringer to be transferred to the acute hospital (which had been necessary), an up-to-date Care Act Assessment had not been completed during the period of her admission to the latter hospital; vii. The risk assessment should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; viii. A positive behaviour support plan should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; ix. A care plan, compliant with CPA Policy and Procedures Key Standard 10, which should have identified a suitable environment in which to manage Mrs Stringer’s risk, her needs and mental health and crisis and contingency planning, to cater for the event of a significant relapse in her mental health, should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; x. Risk behaviour should have been identified to Nightingales and context given, whereas that had not been the case in respect of certain behaviour, including the incident on 30th June 2020; xi. The care coordinator should have been better informed at the points of transfer and discharge; xii. There should have been more robust follow up by the care coordinator whilst Mrs Stringer was at the acute hospital; xiii. There had been no mental health service involvement between the 7-day follow up and 28th September 2020 or, if there had, it had not been recorded; xiv. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible for a manager to carry out a face-to-face assessment in the mental health hospital but no equivalent measure had been implemented; xv) Whereas it would have been helpful for Nightingales to have received the Continuing Healthcare Checklist, it had not been provided; xvi) Nightingales would have wished to see the risk of suicide referred to in the “Risks to the Service User” section of the FACE Overview Assessment; xvii) The court appointed expert had concerns about the accessibility of key information in the FACE Overview Assessment given the format of that document. Whereas the court heard evidence concerning subsequent, significant, purposeful, developments in practice, the matters listed above can be condensed into a single concern that there should be a comprehensive, cohesive, frictionless system for the timely collation (including from the family and/or other carers) and timely communication / transfer of sufficient, accessible information ((not, simply, risk assessments) pertaining to suicide risk in patients / service users / residents, by and between each of the service providers concerned.\n",

In the Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) During the inquest it came to light that John was prescribed medications for depression and epilepsy whilst incarcerated. His compliance with medications was found to be sporadic and as a result he failed to collect a number of prescriptions to enable continuity of his medication. Some of the reasons around this were anxiety in attending to collect his medications and also periods of self-isolation. Whilst Healthcare at the prison were aware of some of the periods of non-compliance and in fact a GP referral and action was taken to enable John to have weekly in-possession medication to support his compliance, other periods were not flagged or identified and it became clear that monitoring those prisoners who are not medication compliant, particularly if receiving weekly or monthly medication was challenging due to the SystmOne electronic patient system not being able to flag a warning for non-compliant prisoners for early identification and referral. John subsequently suffered a decline in his mental health and whilst the lack of medication compliance was not deemed to cause or contribute to his death, the importance of consistent medication for medical conditions and early identification of prisoners who do not comply was an issue which was raised and explored within the inquest. The action taken by the prison after John's suicide was to put a cross check system in place by which pharmacy technicians cross reference the medication by way of a weekly stock check to identify the prisoners who have not collected medications or had the same dispensed, so that referrals can be made to the Healthcare team and or GP to task. Such a system is less than ideal as it is both resource heavy, carries real risks of not being accurate and in the Coroners view, for prisoners in possession of medication, there is likely to be a much longer period before non-compliance is identified which carries real risks of fatalities. The inquest touched upon the SystmOne electronic record used across the Prison estates by Healthcare. From the evidence it appears that the system has a facility to flag concerns and tasks to action and in fact, certain flags are generated automatically to alert healthcare staff to live issues around a prisoner, however, something as simple and the system generating a warning flag to identify when medication is not dispensed or collected was neither possible nor available on the current operating system. An automated flag alert via the system upon the failure to dispense or collect medication by a prisoner would be a far more efficient and effective way in which prisoners failing to comply with medications could be identified and actioned quickly and in which future deaths could be prevented.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) The Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health’s Guidance for Commissioners of Community Specialist Mental Health Services expresses an expectation that there would be more than one clinical psychologist for each Community Mental Health Team, given that clinical psychologists are referred to in the plural within discussions of an appropriate staff team for CMHTs whereas, for example, consultant psychiatrists are referred to in the singular.

(b) that the nursing and clinical records were not kept in accordance with the trust health and record policy. (c) that here was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement has taken place during the period of Christopher’s short stay.

While the Trust has indicated that all staff have received further training in respect of this, I am still not convinced that it is clear as to what is required by staff. b) Following the evidence, the Jury concluded that during Christopher’s time at Langley Green Hospital, no formal review.are plan or adequate risk assessment was carried out in respect of his mental health. (b) that the nursing and clinical records were not kept in accordance with the trust health and record policy. (c) that here was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement has taken place during the period of Christopher’s short stay. Whilst the Trust have indicated that there has been a review of the professional conduct of all staff involved in this case this does not allay my concerns that these practices are limited to just those staff involved in this case. c) Failure to provide staff to accompany a sectioned patient to the emergency department of another Hosptial for treatment for a physical condition. Requesting family member to undertake this role puts the patient and/or the family at risk\n",

      "ORIGINAL TEXT: During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. I heard at inquest that no member of the team on Roman Ward contacted Fallon’s social worker. There was no protocol for this. If they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would have discovered that Fallon’s mum was not dead as Fallon had told them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was never made. It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon discharge. This might be very important for another patient.\n",

There was no redirect and no out of office on her email. Max’s father also tried to call her, with the same result.

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 1) During his initial healthcare screening appointment on the evening he arrived at HMP Hewell ( 25.3.21 ) and his secondary healthcare screening appointment the following day, Mr. McDonald denied any mental health issues, and denied any current thoughts of suicide or self-harm. His community GP records were 2 requested and were received by the prison on 30.3.21; these showed a previous history of depression, and two previous drug overdoses, the most recent of which had been only 7 months earlier; 2) Despite this history, no appointment was made with Mr. McDonald by the healthcare or mental healthcare teams to follow this up with him, and discuss his mental health in more depth; 3) In his evidence to the inquest, the current Head of Healthcare at the prison conceded that it might have been appropriate for someone to have visited Mr. McDonald, raised with him what the GP summary had shown, and asked him if he would like any help, but that he would only have expected any such follow- up if there had been any current concerns about his mental health. He further confirmed that there would have been no automatic follow-up about this, even if staff believed that Mr. McDonald may have deliberately misled them about his mental health history during his healthcare screening appointments; 4) In subsequent correspondence to my office, the Head of Healthcare has suggested that it might be appropriate to delay a prisoner’s secondary healthcare screening appointment until his GP records have been obtained and scrutinised, so that concerns about any history set out in those records can be raised with the prisoner. That proposal is due to be raised at the prison’s next Local Quality Assurance Meeting; 5) I am concerned that there is currently no system in place at HMP Hewell to follow up with a prisoner any discrepancy between the mental health history which he has disclosed on arrival at the prison, and that revealed in his community GP records. Experience suggests that a prisoner with a recorded history of mental health issues, particularly one which includes a recent episode of attempted suicide or self-harm through overdose, may be at his most vulnerable during his first days and weeks at a prison, and having been reluctant to disclose such issues for any number of reasons ( e.g. fear, embarrassment ), may be reassured to be told that healthcare staff at the prison are aware of that history and can provide confidential support. In my view, without routine follow-up in such cases, there remains a significant risk that a prisoner’s recent significant history of suicide or self-harm may be overlooked in those important early days and weeks in prison, and that such prisoners will therefore be at an increased risk of further episodes of attempted suicide during that period.\n",

His community GP records were 2 requested and were received by the prison on 30.3.21; these showed a previous history of depression, and two previous drug overdoses, the most recent of which had been only 7 months earlier; 2) Despite this history, no appointment was made with Mr. McDonald by the healthcare or mental healthcare teams to follow this up with him, and discuss his mental health in more depth; 3) In his evidence to the inquest, the current Head of Healthcare at the prison conceded that it might have been appropriate for someone to have visited Mr. McDonald, raised with him what the GP summary had shown, and asked him if he would like any help, but that he would only have expected any such follow- up if there had been any current concerns about his mental health. He further confirmed that there would have been no automatic follow-up about this, even if staff believed that Mr. McDonald may have deliberately misled them about his mental health history during his healthcare screening appointments; 4) In subsequent correspondence to my office, the Head of Healthcare has suggested that it might be appropriate to delay a prisoner’s secondary healthcare screening appointment until his GP records have been obtained and scrutinised, so that concerns about any history set out in those records can be raised with the prisoner. That proposal is due to be raised at the prison’s next Local Quality Assurance Meeting; 5) I am concerned that there is currently no system in place at HMP Hewell to follow up with a prisoner any discrepancy between the mental health history which he has disclosed on arrival at the prison, and that revealed in his community GP records. Experience suggests that a prisoner with a recorded history of mental health issues, particularly one which includes a recent episode of attempted suicide or self-harm through overdose, may be at his most vulnerable during his first days and weeks at a prison, and having been reluctant to disclose such issues for any number of reasons ( e.g. fear, embarrassment ), may be reassured to be told that healthcare staff at the prison are aware of that history and can provide confidential support. In my view, without routine follow-up in such cases, there remains a significant risk that a prisoner’s recent significant history of suicide or self-harm may be overlooked in those important early days and weeks in prison, and that such prisoners will therefore be at an increased risk of further episodes of attempted suicide during that period.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – (1) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering “traffic duties” on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge. This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them. It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant 3 knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult. (2) While the “Right Care/Right Person” process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support. (3) I am aware that there is a Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide . I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role. (4) I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday – this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzie’s family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have “there is so much responsibility on someone’s head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or not”. I feel that these people should be given a specific set training plan to help them do what is a vital and important role.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: Mr Tidey was arrested on 3rd February 2016 and, whilst in police custody, a 24/39 Adult at Risk or Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (“MASH”) form was completed by police officers giving a Red RAG status with high risk of suicide indicated if his relationship with his partner and specifically his daughter were to fail, and if he lost his job, which were contingent events. He was assessed by a member of the Criminal Liaison and Diversion Service (CLDS) on the same day and was initially assessed by them as being at risk of self-harm. The member of the CLDS subsequently telephoned the Home Treatment Team to discuss referring him to the service. Mr Tidey was then re-assessed by the same member of the CLDS who stated he appeared calmer and was no immediate risk to himself. No notes were recorded on the Police or Mental Health Service computer system to record how this assessment of reduced risk of self-harm had been reached. During the following months, no contact was made by mental health services with Mr Tidey, and he did not seek their assistance. On 26th October 2016 he attended Guildford Police Station to be charged with the offences and was assessed by Police and a member of the CLDS as being at low risk of harm to self. On Friday 16th December 2016, Police were made aware that Mr Tidey had lost his job as a consequence of being charged with the offences and therefore that one of the contingent events highlighted in the MASH referral of 3.2.2016 as placing Mr Tidey at higher risk of self-harm had materialised. They therefore completed a further MASH referral form and this was emailed to the MASH hub at 15.40 and forwarded on to Waverley CMHRS at 16.41. On Monday 19th December 2016 at 11.30am, Waverley CMHRS forwarded the MASH report to Guildford CMHRS, but then emailed again at 11.36am to state they noted Waverley CMHRS should actually follow up Mr Tidey. However, for reasons, which cannot be ascertained, no further action was taken. It is not possible to ascertain who the duty 3 RT4563 worker was who received the referral by email. , Community Services Manager for South West Community Mental Health Recovery Service, stated in evidence that had he received Mr Tidey’s MASH referral on 16th December 2016, he would have taken action the same day, initially via a telephone triage assessment and then via the options available of HTT referral; EDT Mental Health Act Assessment, crisis planning with safe havens or CMHRS non-crisis support, as appropriate. Evidence was given that there were no safeguards in place to check referrals were being acted upon, and that this remains the case. Mr Tidey was found deceased on 22nd December 2016, the day before he was due to attend Court for sentencing. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - How MASH reports are processed by the MASH team upon receipt; - Whether there is an effective system in place to ensure that MASH reports are followed up by the appropriate Community Mental Health Team (where necessary); and - Whether there is an effective system in place to deal appropriately with MASH referrals received outside normal weekday office hours, and that those completing the MASH referral forms (e.g. Police officers) know where these should be send outside normal working hours when a high risk is identified Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – Matter One The inquest heard that the Priory had identified that the garden fence was a risk, in particular the section over the door, in about December 2019. There had been a number of escapes both over the fence and through it, in the months leading up to James’ escape. The number of escapes indicates that garden area was not safe. There was a plan to replace it but there were other priorities. More striking was that there is no national guidance for perimeter fencing and security for the outside areas of mental health ‘locked wards’; unlike that in existence for mental health ‘secure units’. In particular, the height of the fence. While it is accepted that national guidance ought not be necessary to carry out appropriate risk assessments and ensure secure/safe spaces it is clear that such guidance is necessary to ensure the correct level of security for vulnerable patients, whilst benefitting from the therapeutic setting of an outdoor space. Matter Two The evidence showed that there was no appreciation of the emerging pattern of behaviour. A major contributing factor was the lack of exchange and transfer of information at the handover between the consecutive shifts. In particular, the form specifically designed for this with a section for completion – ‘Incidents in last 7 days’ which would have provided an information flow through was not completed. Whilst I heard evidence of steps taken to improve information exchange at a higher level than between ward staff (nurses and HCAs) I was very surprised to hear that no audit of these ‘handover documents’ had been carried out. Given the fundamental importance of the exchange of information between each shift and consecutive shifts I am of the opinion that The Priory have not carried out a sufficiently robust review. Until this failure is addressed there is a significant risk of a breakdown in the communication of adverse events across the shift pattern of several days. The risk of a lack of appreciation of an emerging pattern of behaviour remains.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The gatekeeping assessment included a mental health state examination, where it was the clinical opinion of the mental health practitioner from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team, that Ms Morris required an inpatient hospital admission to a mental health ward as there was an immediate risk to her safety as she was found to be a high risk of walking in front of a car. Whilst Ms Morris agreed to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Emergency Department or to remain in the community whilst waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris had been informed that if she attended the Accident and Emergency Department, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris did not wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that Ms Morris would stay overnight with a family member, and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for Ms Morris to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep her safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts as there is a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds. I am therefore concerned that there is a risk of future deaths as it is not possible to access inpatient mental health beds at the time of clinical need.\n",

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 1. There is a lack of local and national system of in-cell ligature point risk assessments, and no ligature point maps available to staff. Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 The Prison Staff caring for Wyndham were not aware of the location of known ligature points within the cell. This meant that suspicion was not drawn when Wyndham was seen positioned in an area which had access to a ligature point. 2. There is no mandatory requirement for a HMP Prison to have access to a Safer Cell (one with reduced ligature points). HMP Nottingham does not have designated Safer Cells, including on the Care and Support Unit, where prisoners posing a high risk of harm by ligation may be sent for their own safety. The above matters represent missed opportunities to seek to reduce the risk of self-harm and death by ligature asphyxiation, which is one of the most prevalent mechanisms of self-harm and self-inflicted death across the prison estate.

      "CLEANED DATA: 1. There is a lack of local and national system of in-cell ligature point risk assessments, and no ligature point maps available to staff.  The Prison Staff caring for Wyndham were not aware of the location of known ligature points within the cell. This meant that suspicion was not drawn when Wyndham was seen positioned in an area which had access to a ligature point. 2.

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died. The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis. In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter’s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled. The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively. I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts. • This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line. • Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz’s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper. • When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance. 3 2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner’s officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because told my officer about it. • I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest. • I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest. • I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month. • I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest. • I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief. • Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August. This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased.\n",

The evidence was that as a consequence young vulnerable people had to rely on homeless shelters where they were exposed to additional negative influences and as in Tobias’s case abuse due to their sexuality. 3. Evidence was also heard that a person who has to rely on a homeless shelter can then become uncontactable to public service providers as they have no address for contact which means they then have even less chance of accessing support. 4. The inquest was told that young adults who are homeless are often sexually exploited and that those who identify as LGBTQIA can be particularly vulnerable and that the underlying vulnerability and risk was not always appreciated by those dealing with young homeless people and that it could be mistaken by agencies as a lifestyle choice rather than what it actually was, i.e., exploitation by an older adult. 5. The evidence before the inquest was that where multiple agencies were involved it was fundamental that one agency/person took overall ownership/responsibility to ensure a coordinated and effective approach using regular MDTs to understand the information that all agencies had in their possession and to offer effective support.\n",

      "ORIGINAL DATA: During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken in respect of the matters which have not yet been addressed or sufficiently addressed. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows : It was apparent from the evidence that there were five principal failures by the Trust in relation to the treatment and care provided to the Deceased. These were: (1) The Deceased was first assessed by the Trust’s Early Intervention and Assertive Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of psychiatric treatment and care by another team but, despite referring her on to other psychiatric teams within the Trust, made no effective transfer of her care before discharging her back to her General Practitioner and closing her case. A significant number of clinical and managerial staff were involved in this process and none of them prevented the Deceased’s premature discharge. (2) Prior to the Deceased’s discharge no sufficient assessment was made of her risk of suicide. Despite at least two clinical staff being involved, there was insufficient evidence gathering, including from the Deceased’s family, and a wholly inadequate assessment was made despite the use of the Trust’s electronic assessment tool (which was not properly completed). Further, no plan was put in place to manage the Deceased’s recognised risk of suicide. (3) Prior to the Deceased’s discharge no care plan was put in place and no single person had responsibility for ensuring her care was properly assessed, co-ordinated and delivered prior to discharge. (4) The Deceased was discharged back to the care of her General Practitioner with a recommendation for the prescription of psychiatric medication without her having been seen or assessed by the psychiatrist who made the recommendation and with no means of monitoring its subsequent effectiveness. (5) Despite the matters set out in (1) to (4), the General Practitioner’s request, made on 15 March 2016, for an urgent assessment was not granted and the Trust’s Access and Assessment Team provided an appointment for a date five weeks later on 20 April 2016. I was told by witnesses from the Trust (and in submissions made on behalf of the Trust) that the Trust had adequate relevant policies and procedures in place at the time and that the failings set out above occurred because all the staff involved failed to follow those policies and procedures. It was said that there has been no subsequent amendment of the policies and procedures but, in summary, that staff have been reminded of them and what ought to happen (by email) and there is now an increased level of monitoring of compliance. Whilst the staff directly involved, who gave oral evidence at the inquest, told me that they now understand that the above failings ought not to have happened and would not occur now, I remain concerned that one or more of the above failings could recur in the future. Although the Trust has taken steps to inform current staff of what went wrong in the Deceased’s case, it has not taken steps to ensure that the above failings could not occur again (whether by amendment or clarification of its policies and/or procedures or sufficient training of staff or otherwise). Most particularly, the evidence provided to me did not satisfy me that the Trust’s policies and procedures, and the training given upon them, now ensure that every patient who is referred to the Trust will be assessed and treated in a timely manner, even if transfer between teams is necessary. Nor did it satisfy me that every patient’s risk of suicide is now properly assessed and managed so as to ensure the risk is minimised. In all the circumstances I consider that there is an ongoing risk that any one or more of the above failings could recur. If that risk is permitted to continue, it could have an adverse impact on the assessment, treatment and care of current and future patients and upon the protection of their lives.\n",
