    "# Implementing BERTopic for PFD reports\n",
    "\n",
    "BERTopic uses BERT embeddings and clustering algorithms to discover topics. Topics are characterised by dense clusters of semantically similar embeddings, identified through dimensionality reduction and clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than a model, BERTopic is a framework that contains a handful of sub-models, each providing a necessary step in topic representation. These are:\n",
    "* **Embeddings.** This stage represents our text data as a numeric vector to capture sematic meaning and context. This is a core advantage of BERTopic compared to traditional methods such as LDA.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality reduction.** We then take the above embeddings vector and compresses its size to aid computational performance.\n",
    "* **Clustering.** We then cluster our reduced dimension embeddings via unsupervised methods. This essentially extracts our topics.\n",
    "* **TF-IDF.** 'Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency' is the approach taken to extract key words and phrases to represent our topic representations. The TF-IDF approach favours frequent terms but also terms that are unique across our wider text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In BERTopic's modular design, each of the above sub-models is independent, meaning that we can chop and change each of these models, and the downstream tasks will be compatible. \n",

      "Original: 1 Mr McLellan was diagnosed over 2016/16 as being autistic with a designation of Asperger’s Syndrome. He was also diagnosed as experiencing Bipolar Disorder, an attribution he did not accept which he repeatedly asserted to both previous Mental Health care providers and the subsequent Trust clinicians tasked with supporting him at the time of his death, Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust (“TEWV”) 2 He insisted his difficulties were linked to his autism and not mental disorder. It was accepted that he experienced autism and that was part of his individuality and that in addition he may have had a mental health disorder. It was accepted that his care and treatment cannot unbundle the two but he should be treated holistically. 3 Assessment and formulation of risks and safety summary did not fully explore the impact of his autism. There was little to suggest that TEWV staff a) considered the higher prevalence of suicide for individuals with a diagnosis of autism and b) that Regulation 28 – After Inquest OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Mr McLellan may have communicated his distress and risks information differently to an individual without a diagnosis of autism during his periods of crisis or increased risk and c) made sufficient reasonable adjustments in relation to the impact of his autism. 4 At the time of his death, TEWV had progressed from a low baseline in the Trust’s work in North Yorkshire to address perceived underdevelopment in their services for the autistic patient when presenting with a mental health disorder. It had expanded the use of a specialist team (Autism Project Team- “APT”) to extend its work into North Yorkshire caseload. The steps taken were incremental and not all staff understood that Team and access to that important resource. It is recognised that improvements would take time and be resource dependent as well however. 5 APT has three specialist and autism dedicated practitioners working exclusively with autism across the whole Trust in both its regions of commissioned care although there are also non-dedicated clinicians with some expertise of autism within TEWV. TEWV does not treat autism in North Yorkshire. 6 TEWV in its recent audit indicates about 17% of the individuals open to TEWV (over 10,000 in number) have an autism marker ie have an ICD-10 diagnosis of autism or experience suspected/confirmed autism or have a referral including being suspected as autistic. 7 There was no direct causation to the suicide found that directly attributed the acts he took to his autism from the evidence. However Mr McLellan’s distress and stressors before his death included his feelings that he was not getting what he saw to be the right help and that he would not lose his feelings of helplessness such that he took his own life. The concern is that the very significant number of those open to TEWV with an autism marker has increased and will continue to do so and that the higher prevalence of suicide within that expanding group will lead to higher risk of, and numbers of, autistic individuals dying because of suicide both within TEWV locality but also nationally. Urgent solutions are required to prevent further deaths of autistic individuals especially those with mental health disorder by rapidly improving and expanding provisions for assessment and management of risk of harm to themselves for individuals within the autism spectrum while presenting with a mental health disorder.\n",

Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and bythe ICB - Project Fusion I understand is such an example - much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients. It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area - save for private clinics, which many cannot afford. The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented. \n",

    "Our embeddings have high dimensionality, which poses a problem for downstream clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UMAP** is a dimensionality reduction technique that balances the preservation of local and global structures by constructing a high-dimensional graph of the data and optimising its low-dimensional representation. UMAP focuses on maintaining the local structure by ensuring that points that are close together in high-dimensional space remain close in the low-dimensional space. This is achieved through a neighborhood graph that captures local relationships. The relationships captured are, as far as possible, preserved in the lower-dimensional representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option would be **PCA**. PCA is strictly linear and would effectively capture major themes in the PFD reports, such as the distinction between different types of issues (e.g., hospital vs. workplace safety) based on overall variance. However, smaller clusters of reports with very specific concerns might not be well-preserved, as PCA could mix them if their variance is not as significant compared to the global patterns.\n",

Smaller values (e.g., 0.001-0.1) will result in more compact clusters. Larger values (e.g., 0.1-0.5) will spread out clusters, potentially making broader patterns more apparent.\n",

       "{-1: ['I received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who dealt with the investigation into the allegation, and from an investigator from the Metropolitan Police’s Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in particular the consideration of welfare and support offered. I heard evidence: • That when a person who has been RUI’d is charged, standard practice (in accordance with current Metropolitan Police policies and procedures) is for that charge to be communicated to them via a PCR with no advance warning. • That this is the case regardless of the offence, or seriousness of the offence, with which they are being charged. • That in exceptional circumstances, where an individual is considered to be in a high-risk category, arrangements can be made for the PCR to be delivered in person and/or for a third party to be present to provide support. • That it is recognised that certain types of allegation, such as a sexual allegation (as was the case here), may carry a higher risk. This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged (by way of a PCR). • That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the OIC proactively to seek this information. • That there is no formal process for assessing an individual’s mental health and/or risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of delivery of a PCR. It is important to note the following: • At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard. • Many people are RUI’d. As such, PCR is now routinely used to bring most criminal charges. • Individuals who have been RUI’d can remain with this status for long periods of time before a decision is made whether or not to charge them. • Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individual’s mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend a police station for interview, once they have left the police station there are no such formal procedures, notwithstanding the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time they last attended a police station and the time that they are charged. • Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently, have a significant deleterious effect on an individual’s mental health. It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess, at the time of being charged, an individual’s mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR (potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUI’d and potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm). In this case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of the Metropolitan Police. However, these issues clearly arise at a wider (national) level and, as head of the College of Policing, there is overall responsibility for policies/guidance disseminated at a national level.',\n",
       "  'In the words of the Jury: “Initial and all subsequent assessments seriously fail to recognize that the prolonged choice not to eat or drink was in fact an indication of ‘action’ to end their own life and therefore they should have been considered as a suicide risk.” Action is needed to prevent future failure to recognize (a) when the prolonged choice of a patient detained under the Mental Health Act not to eat or drink should be regarded as an action to end their own life; and (b) when such a patient’s prolonged choice not to eat or drink should be recognized as elevating that patient’s suicide risk (including suicide by means other than malnourishment). At the conclusion of the Inquest, after the Jury had returned the completed Record of Inquest, I asked the Norfolk & Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (‘NSFT’) to assist me with written information to inform me of what action is being taken to prevent future deaths related to the “serious failures” in risk assessment as to suicide risk identified by the Jury within their answer to how the individual died. I am grateful for the letter addressed to me from the Deputy Chief Executive & Chief People Officer of NSFT. However, the contents of this letter did not allay my concern in this regard. The letter reiterated factual points that were substantially placed before the Jury in evidence. The letter then set out what appears in my view to be the central point that NSFT wished to make: “At no point prior to or during the individual’s admission, did they present as a risk of self-harm or suicide other than through food or fluid restriction and on that basis there was no evidence to include previous history, recorded thoughts, ideation or plans to identify a risk of ligature. To implement a more restrictive environment upon the individual without evidence to do so would amount to a blanket restriction in breach of Regulations 13 and 17 of the Health and Social Care Act…” This response does not grasp, engage with, or show reflection in light of the Jury’s finding. It therefore does not allay my concern that circumstances creating a risk of further deaths will occur, or will continue to exist, in the future. The Jury’s finding was precisely that the individual did present as a risk of self-harm or suicide other than through food or fluid restriction – and that NSFT failed to recognize this risk as it was expressed by way of the individual choosing not to eat or drink. Although NSFT’s letter argues that implementing a more restrictive environment without evidence to do so would amount to an impermissible blanket restriction, the Jury’s finding was precisely that there was evidence (namely the prolonged choice not to eat and drink) that should have been recognized as being action taken to end their own life and therefore implying an elevated suicide risk. NSFT’s letter goes on to draw my attention to three actions for improvement that are underway or in process. Firstly, “The inpatient clinical team to improve the quality and consistency of their psychological, food and fluid recording and discussions of the same within MDT recording.” While improved discussions regarding food and fluid recording might conceivably trigger recognition of when a refusal to eat or drink indicates suicidal ideation and action, merely recording and discussing food and fluid intake does not necessarily entail recognizing when refusal to eat or drink reflects greater suicide risk. This action on its own does not appear to raise awareness among those conducting suicide risk assessments that a prolonged refusal to eat or drink may reflect an elevated suicide risk, as recognized by the Jury. It may be that review is required on the learning, training, and/or guidance given to assist those undertaking suicide risk assessments in relation to how they should interpret a prolonged refusal to eat or drink and the risk of suicide arising from such action. Of course, it is not for the Coroner to recommend what action is required or to make specific remedial recommendations. Secondly, “The Community and Crisis team were identified as requiring improvement by ensuring routine weighing of patients to provide baseline and discussing and sharing the same…”. Thirdly, “The Crisis team was identified as requiring improvement in respect of ensuring physical health is monitored and considered within assessments…” Neither of these actions address the particular concern highlighted by the Jury’s finding, not least as the serious failures identified by the Jury took place in one location and not in the Community or Crisis teams.',\n",
       "  \"In removing reference to EUPD, which had been discounted, all of which added to her distress. These actions and inactions destroyed her relationship with community mental health clinicians, and she did not trust them enough to try to restore any effective care relationship. She suffered repeated trauma derived from her autistic condition, revisiting the causes of her distress, which she re-experienced time and again with ‘film reel’ recollection. That trauma was again not understood. In short, her autism (and thus risk assessment) was misunderstood by the clinicians tasked to keep her safe. TEWV's provision for care of autistic conditions was underdeveloped, reflecting a national want of provision, to include: A no multidisciplinary clinical assessment and formulation addressed her autism; B no reasonable adjustments were then made in terms of her sensory and environmental needs in any timely fashion, or at all; C no person-centred (thus autism-centred) holistic plan was developed to work in partnership that took account of her autism and her gender. As the evidence revealed, one “cannot uncouple autism and other psychological/psychiatric experiences.” Instead, she withdrew from engagement with TEWV community health clinicians. D there was no local provision within TEWV for specialist autism assessment and adapted psychological therapy. Commissioned providers of these essential cares were outwith TEWV, requiring specific Funding Request (which was granted) for a course of assessment and therapy. Those providers did not offer statutory acute mental health services support, including out-of-hours/crisis support. TEWV did not provide what the commissioned providers were supplying. There was a want of effective communications between these ‘teams,’ not least as patient data was not accessible by one to the others' electronic records (patient consent permitting) and the fact of disengagement. There was a sense of ‘silo’ working, militating against partnership working, that encouraged unfavourably the undesirable “uncoupling” of experiences; E statistical evidence indicated that autistic individuals are more at risk of suicide than those with no neurodevelopmental condition, and females at greater risk than their male counterparts; F there was a clinical (but not measured) experience that more patients were presenting to the statutory service with autistic conditions, and it follows, more patients would be at risk of suicide; G she was detained under ss 2/3 MHA 1983 17 times and presented to A and E around 37 times with evident self-harm and apparent attempts on her life. She repeated high-risk behaviours. She had no Care Co-ordinator nor effective Care Plan (which ought to have been in place) because she had not engaged with TEWV community services; H she lurched from crisis to crisis, remaining at high risk to her own safety; she died because she could no longer cope with the sense of injustice caused by others that overwhelmed her thinking. She felt she was not being listened to by community mental health services. Her therapy from outside providers, which was proving helpful to her, was disrupted by limitations on face-to-face consultations; both locally, including regionally, but also nationally, the evidence revealed a number of serious issues that require urgent and immediate action to support autistic people well, not just from a sensory and environmental basis (which TEWV has started to improve albeit from a low baseline according to the evidence received). Urgent solutions are required to prevent future deaths of autistic patients, especially with mental health needs.\"],\n",
       " 0: ['The next case review was scheduled; however, this did not take place, and there was no further case review prior to their death. The evidence did not reveal why this had not taken place. As the ACCT is a paper-based system, a missed case review is not automatically flagged in any way. Since their death, there has been the implementation of the ACCT assurance process nationally, which requires the ACCT paperwork to be reviewed on three occasions as quality assurance or audit. Firstly, between 25 and 72 hours of the ACCT being opened, secondly at day 7 of the ACCT being opened, and finally at the post-closure review. If a person is subject to an ACCT for a lengthy period of time, there is a gap between day 7 and the post-closure review where no quality assurance is required to be undertaken. Their key worker gave evidence that in an ideal world, prison officers would sit down with a prisoner for 45 minutes once a week to undertake key work as per national guidance. They explained that the two key work sessions they had with the individual lasted no more than 5 minutes and were conducted on the landing outside their cell while other people would be walking around the wing. This was due to the fact the officer had to run the wing at the same time, and they therefore explained the key work sessions were not effective. They confirmed that the key work sessions they undertake now with prisoners would probably be no more than 15 minutes. They further confirmed they were not invited to any of the 11 ACCT case reviews and to date have never been invited to any ACCT reviews for any prisoner, even as a prisoner’s key worker. There is inequity in the system in that if a person is deemed detainable under the Mental Health Act in the community, they will be admitted to hospital straight away. If there is no bed available in a psychiatric unit, they will be placed in an acute hospital where there is monitoring and access to medical care 24 hours a day. If a person is in need of hospital care and treatment under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act, there are delays in the transfer to a hospital setting. When a prisoner suffers a physical health problem, they can be transferred to hospital for care by ambulance or escort. With a mental health care problem, the appropriate paperwork needs to be completed, a hospital bed found, and arrangements made for transfer before a person is admitted to hospital. During this time, a prisoner may be placed in a prison without a healthcare unit and without 24-hour healthcare monitoring and care. The current legal timeframe for this is within 28 days. In relation to the individual, their transfer would have been completed 26 days after they were first assessed. Several witnesses said this was one of the quickest transfers they had experienced. When a code blue or code red is called, evidence was given that the control room does not automatically call an ambulance and before doing so, asks questions such as whether the patient is conscious and breathing. Annex A of Prison Service Instruction (PSI) requires an ambulance to be called automatically as a mandatory contingency response upon a code blue or red being called, and directs staff to await updates from the scene. This PSI is not currently being followed. The individual did not have any contact with their family and when their family was told of their death, they thought it was a mistake as they thought the individual was still at another facility. They had been writing to the individual through the email a prisoner service. There was no evidence their correspondence had reached the individual. Email a prisoner is based on the person in the community who wants to contact the prisoner entering the prisoner’s location in the prison estate, rather than their unique prison number. If the location is wrong or the prisoner has been moved, the prisoner will not receive the contact. The individual told prison staff during their induction and the ACCT assessment that they were in contact with their family and used their parents for support. Familial contact can be a key protective factor in the management of a person’s mental health. In the personal information section of their NOMIS records, they were recorded as having no next of kin. There is no record the contact details of their next of kin were discussed with them. This evidences missed opportunities to involve the individual’s family in their care and management prior to their death. Evidence was given that at the time if there was no next of kin recorded for a prisoner, a monthly report would reveal this and prisoners would be spoken to about this. There is no record the individual was spoken to about this, and it did not appear from the prison there was a clear process as to how next of kin is detailed or checked.',\n",
       "  'ii. During their placement at HMP Lewes, they presented with a deterioration in their mental health and remained subject to an ACCT due to an incident of self-harm, and were also under the care of the healthcare team until the point of their release. iii. Following their arrival at HMP Winchester, which has a residential healthcare unit, referrals were made to the mental health team. They were assessed by a psychiatrist who felt that they were suffering from an enduring psychotic illness and required further review. iv. They were transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. HMP Guys Marsh does not have a healthcare unit or a 24-hour in-prison healthcare provision. The healthcare team operating hours are 7:30 am to 6:00 pm daily. v. An email was sent from the healthcare team at HMP Winchester to the healthcare team at HMP Guys Marsh with their name and that they were a person of interest. No other handover took place between the healthcare teams or the prison staff teams. vi. Following their transfer, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Guys Marsh raised an inappropriate transfer investigation as the clinical opinion was that they should not have been transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. Prior to their transfer, there had not been a discussion with the healthcare teams at HMP Winchester and Guys Marsh by the prison service to consider the suitability of their transfer in view of the fact they were in the process of being assessed, and a confirmed diagnosis being made, relating to their mental health. vii. The Associate Medical Director for Practice Plus Group (PPG) who provided the healthcare at HMP Lewes and HMP Guys Marsh when they were at those establishments confirmed that there is no national directory that explains what healthcare facilities are available at each prison and PPG has created one internally for the prisons they provide healthcare at. It was explained that this would assist when making decisions around the suitability of location within the prison estate for prisoners, given their needs. Further, if there was a national directory across all prisons, this would greatly assist as PPG is only one of the ten different healthcare providers across 114 prisons. They gave an example that they would not know how many disability access beds or cells there are at the prisons where PPG does not provide the healthcare. They also explained that there is no national specification in relation to healthcare units. viii. They were a person with complex needs. Their mental health deteriorated at HMP Guys Marsh. They would spend most of the time in their cell, generally did not engage with staff or ACCT reviews, and there were records that they missed and secreted medication. They held delusional beliefs that if their toilet was flushed or they watched television, their family would come to harm. Their cell was in an extremely poor state, littered with rubbish, an unflushed toilet, and a bucket which was used for them to urinate and defecate in. This bucket was found to be full in their cell at the time of their death. It was acknowledged by the staff at the time that they were self-neglecting and they were referred to the Safety Intervention Meeting (SIM) process.',\n",
       "  \"Joint training is provided, and this is reassuring. However, I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest. The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager advised that they had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of their ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on an individual and the apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents, the quality of the audits is brought into question. Information sharing. In evidence, it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne, which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS, which healthcare staff do not have access to. Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings. In addition, a decision relating to an individual's care (i.e., the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff. Those representing informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers, and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT, and any relevant information is shared via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS, and the multidisciplinary team. They could not assist me with whether this was an initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate. My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered. Cells within the area considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff as the ‘mental health’ cells have 2 cells that are not equipped in a way to reduce the number of available ligature points. It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move an individual to the ‘mental health cells’ simply due to the fact they were on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. It was informed to me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition, I was informed that all telephone points in the ‘mental health cells’ have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments. However, at inquest, those representing could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self-harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by the design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so. I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells that prison and healthcare staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self-harm. The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However, certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that there are high levels of self-harm and suicide, and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN.

There was no evidence within the notes that the risk of relapse if a medication is stopped was discussed, nor is there evidence that the patient was told they may feel worse before they feel better. I did not find that this advice was not given, simply that I could not say either way. When asked, evidence was that risks would be discussed when prescribing the drug, but it was not entirely clear as to which risks would be discussed, and it was given that it is likely each GP has a different approach, bearing in mind the time limitations of the appointment. They could not say with confidence that every GP within the practice was discussing these key risks. A copy of the relevant NICE guidance was provided to me which states that these risks should be discussed with the patient, and I look specifically at sections 1.3.1 and 1.5.2 as a minimum. I am concerned that this guidance is not being followed as a matter of routine within the surgery and that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. I am also concerned that a significant event meeting has not yet taken place, despite the patient’s death being some time ago. The evidence was that this will take place after the inquest and I am concerned that, if this is the practice following all deaths, there is a risk that learning from deaths will be delayed or missed.',\n",

I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription, since it was not in accord with current advice. I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patients suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it. I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis, and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks.'],\n",

Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (‘BSMHFT’) wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit; however, no bed was available, and they remained in the community. Shortly before their death, the deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act. There was no available ‘place of safety,’ and they had to be taken to an emergency department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital doctors agreed the deceased needed to be assessed under the mental health act; however, the local council could not provide an approved mental health practitioner (‘AMPH’) to attend in a 24-hour period. When the section 136 lapsed, the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health nurse. At the time of their death, the deceased was on BSMHFT’s waiting list for a care coordinator. The lack of care coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, ‘place of safety,’ and AMHPs presents a risk that seriously mentally ill people are not receiving necessary treatment.

While there was agreement to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and Emergency Department or to remain in the community while waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. It was informed that if attendance at the Accident and Emergency Department occurred, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. There was no wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that the individual would stay overnight with a family member and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team, who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for the individual to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep them safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts due to a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds.

A statement from a Detective Sergeant revealed, “A yellow padlock was locked onto the sliding bolt, to give an illusion it was locked; however, the clasp had not been held down into the lock, so it could have been opened by any person.” It was also established in evidence that the witness did not know any of the residents of Tavistock Chambers or in the vicinity generally. As such, it appeared that their entry to the building was entirely opportunistic. However, that aside, the evidence suggested that both of the safety systems installed to prevent unauthorised access to the building were not working effectively at that time.

In addition, there does not appear to be any notification to the mental health team to say that the person has been in contact such that this can be followed up. It is likely that there is notification to the GP, but in this case, there was no detail provided which could have been passed on, and the timescales for review of correspondence by the GP, who again are operating somewhat in isolation from the mental health team, do not lend themselves to the prompt action which may be required by the mental health team.

I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfill care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in their evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst they were able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, they were unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and were unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.

The application invites them to disclose any history they have of mental health problems; upon being accepted on a course of study, this information is provided to the admitting university. It was indicated that the mental health disclosure information is used to target students that may require support, and at UAL, emails are sent to undergraduates, inviting them to register with the university's support services. Regrettably, it would appear that of UAL's cohort of students that disclosed mental health problems to UCAS, only 66% of undergraduates responded to the email invitation offering mental health support. The remaining 33%, a total of some 200 students, did not respond to the offer. I asked whether the identity of students who had made a mental health disclosure in their UCAS application was communicated to tutors and halls of residence staff at the university.

Notwithstanding their neurodiversity - which of itself was a barrier to them being able to reach out or to seek help - I am concerned about the level of awareness, understanding, and curiosity of academic staff around the mental health of students, particularly in the post-pandemic climate, where interruptions to their study and dysregulated student life have had a significant impact on their mental health. Whilst it was explained to me that all staff are offered training on mental health management and are provided with guidance on how to support students, I am concerned that aspects of this are not made compulsory for academic staff. Where a myriad of training options are made available to staff and often required of them, with very little practical time available in which to do it, there is a risk that modules and aids with regard to mental health will not be prioritized, followed through, or addressed. There is, as I understand it, no evident monitoring in respect of which staff have viewed or undertaken what training or indeed in respect of who has completed the modules on offer. It remains unclear as to who or how many staff have actually viewed or undertaken the online training around student mental health. Although the process of ‘raising a concern’ by academic staff is a means by which such matters can be considered and is a process set up and encouraged through the student hubs, I am concerned that in not ensuring that academic staff are at least armed with the ability to spot or to know when to make initial inquiries of students or are clearly guided on how best to do so (particularly with regard to an understanding of the needs and skills required to liaise with students with neurodiversity), there is a risk that an over-focus on academic policies and procedures will endure and that those students who are struggling to adhere to them will be missed or overlooked.'],\n",

Further, all records showed that the timings of observations were at precise intervals. This is not in accordance with the Trust’s policy of observations (which confirms that observations should be irregular but within the (e.g., 30-minute) window.

There was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement had taken place during the period of the patient's short stay.

       "  'At the time they sought to strangle themselves with a cord, they were an informal patient at the Conway Ward, a mental health facility. At the inquest, evidence was heard from a number of members of staff regarding what constitutes an effective observation. They were the subject of what were described as Safety and Security [SAS] and general observations, the completion of which was the responsibility of a number of members of care staff. The evidence heard from staff raised an area of concern because that evidence indicated quite clearly that there was a lack of consistency and clarity regarding what constitutes an effective observation. An independent expert witness indicated in a report that they completed prior to the inquest that they felt custom and practice was such that some staff were merely checking on the “whereabouts” of the patient. Some staff felt that they were expected to enter the room of the patient and to try to engage with them and to check the room environment for anything that may pose a risk to them. Others felt that whether they were expected to actually enter a patient’s room to conduct the observation could vary depending on the level of risk a particular patient presented; in other words, they felt they had an element of discretion regarding whether they entered the room. This evidence appeared to be in contrast to a Trust policy. In the case of the patient, as can be seen above, they had limited understanding of English, and a number of staff gave evidence that they remained in their room throughout their time on the Conway Ward and did not wish to engage with them. Nevertheless, the author of the Trust’s Sudden Untoward Incident Review document agreed that there was no such discretion and that staff ought to enter the room to complete an effective observation. At the conclusion of the inquest, I expressed the view that I was concerned that there is a risk of future deaths because staff remain unclear about what amounts to an effective observation, and more specifically whether there are circumstances which may allow them to refrain from verbally engaging with a patient, or from physically entering a patient’s room to check the environment, and that should that lack of consistency and clarity prevail, other patients may be placed at risk as a result of inadequate observations. For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I am of the opinion that the above concern remains valid despite the fact that further to the patient’s death, the provision of mental health care for patients such as them has moved from the Conway Ward to another facility within my jurisdiction at which members of staff who were working at the time of the patient’s death continue to be employed in a similar capacity.'],\n",

       " 15: ['Sadly, this case exposes the totally inadequate level of community provision for the care and treatment of those suffering with Autism. This is a national problem and sadly leads to many experiencing unnecessary admissions to inpatient mental health facilities and also A&E attendances. Despite a report from the Health and Social Care committee, this case showed that there does not seem to have been any real improvement and more lives are likely to be lost. Reading from this report, it says, “The conclusion of this report was that Autistic people (and people with learning disabilities) have the right to live independent, free, and fulfilled lives in the community and it is an unacceptable violation of their human rights to deny them the chance to do so.” The report identified that “the community support and provision for autistic people (and those with learning difficulties) and financial investment in those services is significantly below the level required to meet the needs of those individuals and to provide adequate support for them in the community.” The Inquest heard that there still remains an acute shortage of provision. Evidence was heard that a local council had tried over 30 providers to help put in place support for an individual but they could not find a placement for her, so the only provision that they were able to offer her was supported housing with temporary care agency staff. This provision broke down, which exacerbated her mental health. This then led to a hospital mental inpatient admission.',\n",
       "  'This case identified that there is a lack of clear understanding of the risk or accountability between the agencies when a young person transitions from CAMBS services to adult services. The expert who provided evidence in this case said that this was a well-recognized problem and while services across the country had tried to address this, there was a lack of national guidance and provision. In this particular case, the individual was particularly vulnerable. They had struggled emotionally during their teens and had indulged in alcohol and drugs. They had been detained on a number of occasions due to their mental health. Upon transitioning to adult services, there was a lack of a recognized pathway for them. In the lead-up to their death, they had been discharged from a mental health provision following their arrest for criminal offenses. They were then discharged from the hospital and subsequently the police station to temporary accommodation. There was little shared understanding between agencies of how the individual should best be supported and therefore they appeared to fall between the services. Substantial changes have been made locally by Sussex Partnership Foundation NHS Trust around the transition of those from CAMBS to adult health services, but looking at other Prevention of Future Death Reports, this is not just a local issue. There is a lack of national guidance and support in relation to the multi-agency approach that is needed to support those young people transitioning to adult health and social care services. Unless this is addressed nationally, sadly other deaths will occur.',\n",
       "  'They were failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist, there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. They were not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist, despite there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling them to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Their parents did everything they could during this period to support them, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly their mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and they took their own life. Initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner. I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services, but there were many failings in the care provided. It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant underfunding of the local mental health Trust, which, like many mental health Trusts, has seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services (CAMHS). By way of an example: referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6%.'],\n",
       " 16: ['Following the decision, no discharge plan or follow-up support was put in place.',\n",
       "  'As there was no process in place to require contacting a carer on discharge where there is no CPA in place, a patient could be discharged without notice to a carer, and as such, care that is anticipated to be in place on discharge may not be available.',\n",
       "  'They were discharged from the Unit without a discharge planning meeting taking place in circumstances where there was no confirmation that they were eligible for housing provision and with no plan as to what would happen after the placement ended.

       " 17: ['Continued staffing pressures within Primary Mental Health Services are resulting in assessment delays and waiting lists for support, e.g., the waiting list for LPMHSS counselling remains at 4 – 6 months. There is no evidence that the waiting list will improve moving forward. \\n\\nWhilst awaiting counselling, the only interim support available to patients assessed as mild or low risk are services that come with a requirement to self-refer, despite lack of motivation being a common symptom. The LPMHSS does not have a standardized process for referring low-risk patients for interim support, and no interim contact or monitoring is offered or arranged (unless patients have self-referred to an organization providing such services).',\n",
       "  'The inquest heard that psychology assessment and therapies can be very beneficial to those with mental health issues in secondary services as well as primary services.

       " 18: ['The Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust’s Serious Incident Investigation Report identified numerous matters and learning points, including, but not limited to the following: • There had been a lack of “professional curiosity” in the assessment and planning of care and treatment • “Discussions and assessments of risk should be clearly documented” • “Risk formulations should consider both current and historic/contextual risks and incorporate ratings of mood to ensure that these are not used in isolation and are linked with appropriate interventions” • There were “missed opportunities identified in relation to self-reported deterioration following discharge from hospital which do not appear to have been fully explored.” However, the Serious Incident Investigation Report does not include any plan to address the concerns it identified. As such, there is insufficient reassurance that there is a plan to address the matters in a meaningful way moving forward.',\n",
       "  'I remain gravely concerned about the inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust. The Serious Incident Investigation failed to identify the errors in the care provided, making the use of the process somewhat otiose in this case. The failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where errors in care were uncovered for the first time at inquest. I am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the care provided before the death has caused a delay and led to missed opportunities for some staff to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety. My concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust Serious Incident Investigations and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the CRISIS Team. The risks have the ability to prevent learning, therefore negatively impacting patient safety across the entire Trust.',\n",
       "  'Inadequate review and incident investigation following a death. Following a death, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust completed an SI Review by way of case note review. Following evidence which considered the content of that review, the Trust stated that the review was ‘insufficient in its current form and the scope should be broadened to include the concerns raised (during the inquest hearing).’ The Trust said its Patient Safety Investigation Lead would undertake a new SI Review. I identified a number of deficiencies with the initial SI Review which had been undertaken: it did not identify that a request from a GP for involvement of its service had not been actioned; it incorrectly identified areas where improvements were required as areas of good practice; and it did not involve any level of consultation with the family to consider whether there were any areas of concern they had which might direct elements of the review. If there is insufficient review and learning from a death that, in my judgment, adds to the likelihood of future deaths occurring in similar circumstances. I am not reassured that necessary actions to address the serious issue identified i.e. inadequate initial review and incident investigation following a death, are yet in place.']}"
