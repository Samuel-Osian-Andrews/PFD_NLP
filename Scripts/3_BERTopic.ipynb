    "# Implementing BERTopic for PFD reports\n",
    "\n",
    "BERTopic uses BERT embeddings and clustering algorithms to discover topics. Topics are characterised by dense clusters of semantically similar embeddings, identified through dimensionality reduction and clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than a model, BERTopic is a framework that contains a handful of sub-models, each providing a necessary step in topic representation. These are:\n",
    "* **Embeddings.** This stage represents our text data as a numeric vector to capture sematic meaning and context. This is a core advantage of BERTopic compared to traditional methods such as LDA.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality reduction.** We then take the above embeddings vector and compresses its size to aid computational performance.\n",
    "* **Clustering.** We then cluster our reduced dimension embeddings via unsupervised methods. This essentially extracts our topics.\n",
    "* **TF-IDF.** 'Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency' is the approach taken to extract key words and phrases to represent our topic representations. The TF-IDF approach favours frequent terms but also terms that are unique across our wider text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In BERTopic's modular design, each of the above sub-models is independent, meaning that we can chop and change each of these models, and the downstream tasks will be compatible. \n",

    "Before embedding our text, it's useful to first split our reports into sentences. BERTopic generally performs poorly on larger documents, as this tends to result in noisy topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting our reports into sentences means that BERTopic will not represent individual reports with a topic out-of-the-box, but we can do this manually (for example, by aggreagating topics within each report)."

    "Our embeddings have high dimensionality, which poses a problem for downstream clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UMAP** is a dimensionality reduction technique that balances the preservation of local and global structures by constructing a high-dimensional graph of the data and optimising its low-dimensional representation. UMAP focuses on maintaining the local structure by ensuring that points that are close together in high-dimensional space remain close in the low-dimensional space. This is achieved through a neighborhood graph that captures local relationships. The relationships captured are, as far as possible, preserved in the lower-dimensional representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option would be **PCA**. PCA is strictly linear and would effectively capture major themes in the PFD reports, such as the distinction between different types of issues (e.g., hospital vs. workplace safety) based on overall variance. However, smaller clusters of reports with very specific concerns might not be well-preserved, as PCA could mix them if their variance is not as significant compared to the global patterns.\n",

Smaller values (e.g., 0.001-0.1) will result in more compact clusters. Larger values (e.g., 0.1-0.5) will spread out clusters, potentially making broader patterns more apparent.\n",
