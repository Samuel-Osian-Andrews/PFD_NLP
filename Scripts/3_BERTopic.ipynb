    "# Implementing BERTopic for PFD reports\n",
    "\n",
    "BERTopic uses BERT embeddings and clustering algorithms to discover topics. Topics are characterised by dense clusters of semantically similar embeddings, identified through dimensionality reduction and clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than a model, BERTopic is a framework that contains a handful of sub-models, each providing a necessary step in topic representation. These are:\n",
    "* **Embeddings.** This stage represents our text data as a numeric vector to capture sematic meaning and context. This is a core advantage of BERTopic compared to traditional methods such as LDA.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality reduction.** We then take the above embeddings vector and compresses its size to aid computational performance.\n",
    "* **Clustering.** We then cluster our reduced dimension embeddings via unsupervised methods. This essentially extracts our topics.\n",
    "* **TF-IDF.** 'Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency' is the approach taken to extract key words and phrases to represent our topic representations. The TF-IDF approach favours frequent terms but also terms that are unique across our wider text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In BERTopic's modular design, each of the above sub-models is independent, meaning that we can chop and change each of these models, and the downstream tasks will be compatible. \n",

      "Original: 1 Mr McLellan was diagnosed over 2016/16 as being autistic with a designation of Asperger’s Syndrome. He was also diagnosed as experiencing Bipolar Disorder, an attribution he did not accept which he repeatedly asserted to both previous Mental Health care providers and the subsequent Trust clinicians tasked with supporting him at the time of his death, Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust (“TEWV”) 2 He insisted his difficulties were linked to his autism and not mental disorder. It was accepted that he experienced autism and that was part of his individuality and that in addition he may have had a mental health disorder. It was accepted that his care and treatment cannot unbundle the two but he should be treated holistically. 3 Assessment and formulation of risks and safety summary did not fully explore the impact of his autism. There was little to suggest that TEWV staff a) considered the higher prevalence of suicide for individuals with a diagnosis of autism and b) that Regulation 28 – After Inquest OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Mr McLellan may have communicated his distress and risks information differently to an individual without a diagnosis of autism during his periods of crisis or increased risk and c) made sufficient reasonable adjustments in relation to the impact of his autism. 4 At the time of his death, TEWV had progressed from a low baseline in the Trust’s work in North Yorkshire to address perceived underdevelopment in their services for the autistic patient when presenting with a mental health disorder. It had expanded the use of a specialist team (Autism Project Team- “APT”) to extend its work into North Yorkshire caseload. The steps taken were incremental and not all staff understood that Team and access to that important resource. It is recognised that improvements would take time and be resource dependent as well however. 5 APT has three specialist and autism dedicated practitioners working exclusively with autism across the whole Trust in both its regions of commissioned care although there are also non-dedicated clinicians with some expertise of autism within TEWV. TEWV does not treat autism in North Yorkshire. 6 TEWV in its recent audit indicates about 17% of the individuals open to TEWV (over 10,000 in number) have an autism marker ie have an ICD-10 diagnosis of autism or experience suspected/confirmed autism or have a referral including being suspected as autistic. 7 There was no direct causation to the suicide found that directly attributed the acts he took to his autism from the evidence. However Mr McLellan’s distress and stressors before his death included his feelings that he was not getting what he saw to be the right help and that he would not lose his feelings of helplessness such that he took his own life. The concern is that the very significant number of those open to TEWV with an autism marker has increased and will continue to do so and that the higher prevalence of suicide within that expanding group will lead to higher risk of, and numbers of, autistic individuals dying because of suicide both within TEWV locality but also nationally. Urgent solutions are required to prevent further deaths of autistic individuals especially those with mental health disorder by rapidly improving and expanding provisions for assessment and management of risk of harm to themselves for individuals within the autism spectrum while presenting with a mental health disorder.\n",

Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and bythe ICB - Project Fusion I understand is such an example - much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients. It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area - save for private clinics, which many cannot afford. The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented. \n",

    "Our embeddings have high dimensionality, which poses a problem for downstream clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UMAP** is a dimensionality reduction technique that balances the preservation of local and global structures by constructing a high-dimensional graph of the data and optimising its low-dimensional representation. UMAP focuses on maintaining the local structure by ensuring that points that are close together in high-dimensional space remain close in the low-dimensional space. This is achieved through a neighborhood graph that captures local relationships. The relationships captured are, as far as possible, preserved in the lower-dimensional representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another option would be **PCA**. PCA is strictly linear and would effectively capture major themes in the PFD reports, such as the distinction between different types of issues (e.g., hospital vs. workplace safety) based on overall variance. However, smaller clusters of reports with very specific concerns might not be well-preserved, as PCA could mix them if their variance is not as significant compared to the global patterns.\n",

Smaller values (e.g., 0.001-0.1) will result in more compact clusters. Larger values (e.g., 0.1-0.5) will spread out clusters, potentially making broader patterns more apparent.\n",

       "{-1: ['5.1 While acknowledging the high level of contact with the IHBTT team, the evidence was that no one was taking responsibility for their care in a ‘key worker’ type role. The large number of people seeing them did not make deep professional relationships with them, which would allow their needs and risks to be addressed in a person-centred and properly risk-sensitive way. The relationships with them were superficial, and this affected the risk assessment process. The large number of mental health professionals in contact with them inhibited the establishment of deep relationships of trust. 5.2 The risk assessments themselves were therefore superficial, often relying uncritically on self-reporting without meaningfully engaging in suicide risk prevention. The initial risk assessment on first contact was flawed in that, despite the presenting context being an attempt at suicide by hanging, the risk assessment was ‘low risk of suicide’. 5.3 There was a failure to meaningfully communicate and engage with their Regiment and the medical staff attached to it. 5.4 Communication with the family was superficial, and the evidence was that their perception was that they couldn’t fully share issues and concerns because of perceived barriers in information sharing. This may not have been the team’s intention, but it was the reality felt by the family. This inhibited their engagement with the team in their best interests. The evidence was that engagement with the family was important because they were the people who knew them best and who would be the first to identify any risks or concerns. 5.5 There was evidence that staff in the team struggled with decision-making around information sharing. For example, the day before they died, their girlfriend called to share concerns about their wellbeing. The person taking the call indicated that their lack of knowledge of the referral placed the team in difficulty in sharing the information. In the event, a practitioner saw them for a visit only a few minutes later and correctly identified their need for an urgent psychiatric review. Notwithstanding this, I considered that this was evidence of a failure to understand the basics of risk-based information sharing. 5.6 In summary, therefore, I considered that there was evidence that a failure to address these issues could create a risk of further deaths: • Superficiality of risk assessments • Lack of a key worker approach • Lack of communication with the armed forces • Superficiality of communication with the family • Anxiety about appropriate risk sharing',\n",
       "  'The court heard evidence and/or found that a number of steps had not been taken pertaining to the transfer of information concerning the risk of suicide. They included the following: i. The care coordinator should have requested that the acute hospital make a referral to the Mental Health Liaison Team for a review; ii. It would have been good practice for a further professionals meeting / CPA review to have taken place prior to formal discharge and no later than just after discharge to Nightingales and for the family to have been invited, to ensure that everyone was aware of the plan, that the family was aware of the legal status and to discuss next steps in terms of liaison with other services; iii. There should have been greater professional curiosity and better communication at the time of transfer; iv. The Harbour mental health hospital’s RNNA should have been reviewed to determine whether it needed to be updated and it should have been updated if there was any different clinical information. Further self-harm or suicidal ideation, if seen to be significant, should have given rise to a further RNNA; v. There had, in fact, been further indications of self-harm and suicidal ideation and, in any event, of a wish to die, which were significant and should have been addressed in the information provided to Nightingales and had not been; vi. The individual was discharged from The Harbour mental health hospital without an up-to-date Care Act Assessment and, in any event, taking into account the need for the individual to be transferred to the acute hospital (which had been necessary), an up-to-date Care Act Assessment had not been completed during the period of admission to the latter hospital; vii. The risk assessment should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; viii. A positive behaviour support plan should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; ix. A care plan, compliant with CPA Policy and Procedures Key Standard 10, which should have identified a suitable environment in which to manage the risk, needs, mental health, and crisis and contingency planning, to cater for the event of a significant relapse in mental health, should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; x. Risk behaviour should have been identified to Nightingales and context given, whereas that had not been the case in respect of certain behaviour, including the incident; xi. The care coordinator should have been better informed at the points of transfer and discharge; xii. There should have been more robust follow-up by the care coordinator whilst the individual was at the acute hospital; xiii. There had been no mental health service involvement between the 7-day follow-up and the end of September or, if there had, it had not been recorded; xiv. During the pandemic, it was not possible for a manager to carry out a face-to-face assessment in the mental health hospital but no equivalent measure had been implemented; xv. Whereas it would have been helpful for Nightingales to have received the Continuing Healthcare Checklist, it had not been provided; xvi. Nightingales would have wished to see the risk of suicide referred to in the “Risks to the Service User” section of the FACE Overview Assessment; xvii. The court-appointed expert had concerns about the accessibility of key information in the FACE Overview Assessment given the format of that document. Whereas the court heard evidence concerning subsequent, significant, purposeful developments in practice, the matters listed above can be condensed into a single concern that there should be a comprehensive, cohesive, frictionless system for the timely collation (including from the family and/or other carers) and timely communication / transfer of sufficient, accessible information (not, simply, risk assessments) pertaining to suicide risk in patients / service users / residents, by and between each of the service providers concerned.',\n",
       "  \"A. Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust  \\nConcern 1  \\nThe evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible for the triage of referrals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an “Access and Advice Team” but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 2  \\nThe evidence at the inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years, a child never received the clinical assessment needed. I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child being seen and assessed by a clinical team. I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of the new Mindworks service, is intended to ensure that a referred child’s needs are properly identified and met. However, on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils, I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed (for example because the child, at an early stage, declines to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this context, I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers (so that any ongoing “barriers” in the system, which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams, can then be identified and eliminated). Concern 3  \\nThe evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria for crisis, urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine. I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as “low risk”. I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria for crisis, urgent or priority but, like others, may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm. The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its “routine” cases to be addressed. It seems inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged. Concern 4  \\nI was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to children’s mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trust’s new working practices but that this has not yet been done. I am concerned that important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a referred child’s records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child/family are spoken to) are not yet established in written guidance. Concern 5  \\nThe evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that a child’s medical conditions, including the risk of self-harm and suicide, and the consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in the Education, Health and Care Plan, failed to do so; this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard. On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing, I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process. I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities.  \\nB. Surrey County Council (and National) (i) Education and Special Educational Needs Department  \\nConcern 6  \\nThe evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education / SEN Department, including caseworkers, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 7  \\nThe evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before a child's death, they were moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet their complex needs. I found that the inappropriate placement, by the council, of the child into the mainstream school contributed to their death. Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with the child’s Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this failed adequately to identify and record their mental and emotional health concerns, their risk of suicidal ideation, their consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which the child was being moved. I was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by the special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet the child’s needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the child’s EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school. I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing. On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the case), it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective school’s ability to meet the child’s needs. I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing, sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the child’s needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school. I am concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally, to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools’ powers and duties to share information and documents, and any data protection ramifications this may have.  \\n(ii) Children’s Services Department  \\nConcern 8  \\nThe evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Children’s Services Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 9  \\nAt the inquest I found that following a final referral to the Children’s Services Department, there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of the situation and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate the case appropriately. I found that this contributed to the death. The inappropriate allocation resulted, in part, from the application of the then “threshold of needs” document, which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about the revised “threshold of needs” document, as well as the recent guidance (including a “toolbox”) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced since the death. Despite these changes, I remain concerned that the “threshold of needs” document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties, self-harm, and suicidal ideation for autistic children (given their prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentially, there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support, as was the case for the child.  \\nC. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group (and National)  \\nConcern 10  \\nAt the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence concerning the post-death reviews conducted into a child's death by the Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Safeguarding Children Partnership. The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death; I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of the death, and only very limited learning was identified. Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and/or national process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post-death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest process, is achieved in all cases.  \\nD. National Issues  \\nConcern 11  \\nFrom the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was apparent that the national “Working Together” guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe. It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the child’s family and parent(s) and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to the child and their family. I am concerned that “Working Together” does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism, and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families.  \\nConcern 12  \\nThe evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence of more training being available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and mandatory training. I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children. I am concerned that this poses an ongoing risk to autistic children and their ability to access the services they require for their support, welfare, and safeguarding.\"],\n",

Although I found on the balance of probabilities that it remained unclear that he was suffering from this side effect, it remained possible for this to be the case. I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription, since it was not in accord with current advice. I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patients suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it. I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis, and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks.',\n",
       "  'The administration from day four of the hospital admission reprecipitated serotonin syndrome and directly contributed to the death. The Trust has recognized this and amended its sedation policy to recommend \"lower risk\" opiates (such as morphine) be used in patients who have taken overdoses of medications where there is a risk of serotonin syndrome/toxicity. It is accepted that the way they interacted in this case was unexpected and appears to have occurred due to the particular circumstances of the case; in particular, an aspiration pneumonia requiring treatment in the prone position and the development of a paralytic ileus. However, these complications are not unusual in patients who have taken overdoses of these types of medications, and as such, I consider there is a risk a future death may occur in similar circumstances. I am concerned that other NHS organizations may not fully appreciate the risks associated with the use of in patients such as those in this case and that this information should be shared with those organizations on a national level.',\n",

There was no evidence within the notes that the risk of relapse if a medication is stopped was discussed, nor is there evidence that the patient was told they may feel worse before they feel better. I did not find that this advice was not given, simply that I could not say either way. When asked, evidence was that risks would be discussed when prescribing the drug, but it was not entirely clear as to which risks would be discussed, and it was given that it is likely each GP has a different approach, bearing in mind the time limitations of the appointment. They could not say with confidence that every GP within the practice was discussing these key risks. A copy of the relevant NICE guidance was provided to me which states that these risks should be discussed with the patient, and I look specifically at sections 1.3.1 and 1.5.2 as a minimum. I am concerned that this guidance is not being followed as a matter of routine within the surgery and that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. I am also concerned that a significant event meeting has not yet taken place, despite the patient’s death being some time ago. The evidence was that this will take place after the inquest and I am concerned that, if this is the practice following all deaths, there is a risk that learning from deaths will be delayed or missed.'],\n",

(iii) A large proportion of the prisoners arriving have mental health issues (iv) The mental health team is mainly a nurse-led service (v) The division of labor between mental health nurses and psychiatrists is that a doctor is responsible for the diagnosis of mental illness, prescribing medication such as antipsychotic drugs and seeing prisoners/patients with severe or complex conditions. Mental health nurses make initial assessments and provide ongoing care. (vi) Concern was expressed about the adequacy of the psychiatric doctor provision to provide psychiatric treatment for a large population which includes men with significant mental health issues. (vii) They were deemed to require assessment by a psychiatrist as a non-urgent case but at the time of their death no appointment had been given. (viii) A mental health nurse working on behalf of PPG identified the possibility of emerging psychotic features and noted the sentiment that engaging in treatment as soon as possible militated in favor of a better outcome.

There is a lack of NHS guidance, and joint guidance with HMPPS, on the identification, management, and treatment of someone with self-neglect in the prison setting. iii. There is a lack of a national directory detailing the facilities and provision of healthcare at individual prisons across England and Wales, and associated guidance on the transfer of individuals between prison establishments when they are under the care of the healthcare teams and are not placed on medical hold. There is a lack of guidance on consultation with prison doctors where a prisoner is receiving medical care, whether that be for physical or mental health, when there is consideration by the prison to transfer the prisoner who is not placed on medical hold. Further, there is a lack of consultation with the healthcare team at the proposed receiving prison to ensure they can provide the appropriate care for the person. iv.

There is a lack of national specification in respect of prison healthcare units. vi. There is a lack of national guidance for both senior management and operational prison staff in relation to the handover of a prisoner in advance of their transfer, not specific to, but especially those with complex needs, when transferring between prisons. vii. The lack of ACCT quality assurance, or audit, between day 7 of the ACCT and the post-closure review. viii. There is a lack of automatic flagging of a missed ACCT review at one prison, and this could also be a national problem. ix. Relevant individuals, such as key workers, are not being invited to attend ACCT reviews at one prison in line with ACCT 6 guidance. x. The keyworker scheme is not being delivered in line with national guidance at one prison. xi. The colour of the cell doors and bedsheets at one prison, and possibly at other prisons nationally, being very similar can camouflage ligatures. xii.

There is a lack of process regarding the recording of a prisoner’s next of kin and involvement of them at one prison. xiv.

Following their arrival at HMP Winchester, which has a residential healthcare unit, referrals were made to the mental health team. They were assessed by a psychiatrist who felt that they were suffering from an enduring psychotic illness and required further review. iv. They were transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. HMP Guys Marsh does not have a healthcare unit or a 24-hour in-prison healthcare provision. The healthcare team operating hours are 7:30 am to 6:00 pm daily. v. An email was sent from the healthcare team at HMP Winchester to the healthcare team at HMP Guys Marsh with their name and that they were a person of interest. No other handover took place between the healthcare teams or the prison staff teams. vi. Following their transfer, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Guys Marsh raised an inappropriate transfer investigation as the clinical opinion was that they should not have been transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. Prior to their transfer, there had not been a discussion with the healthcare teams at HMP Winchester and Guys Marsh by the prison service to consider the suitability of their transfer in view of the fact they were in the process of being assessed, and a confirmed diagnosis being made, relating to their mental health. vii. The Associate Medical Director for Practice Plus Group (PPG) who provided the healthcare at HMP Lewes and HMP Guys Marsh when they were at those establishments confirmed that there is no national directory that explains what healthcare facilities are available at each prison and PPG has created one internally for the prisons they provide healthcare at. It was explained that this would assist when making decisions around the suitability of location within the prison estate for prisoners, given their needs. Further, if there was a national directory across all prisons, this would greatly assist as PPG is only one of the ten different healthcare providers across 114 prisons. They gave an example that they would not know how many disability access beds or cells there are at the prisons where PPG does not provide the healthcare. They also explained that there is no national specification in relation to healthcare units. viii. They were a person with complex needs. Their mental health deteriorated at HMP Guys Marsh. They would spend most of the time in their cell, generally did not engage with staff or ACCT reviews, and there were records that they missed and secreted medication. They held delusional beliefs that if their toilet was flushed or they watched television, their family would come to harm. Their cell was in an extremely poor state, littered with rubbish, an unflushed toilet, and a bucket which was used for them to urinate and defecate in. This bucket was found to be full in their cell at the time of their death.

I received evidence from NSFT concerning the measures that organization had undertaken to address my concerns. This evidence included the following: a. Care Group communication has improved across the Trust. b. Skills Training on Risk Management (STORM), covering suicide and self-harm awareness training, was being implemented across the Trust. c. Staff were being engaged concerning waiting lists and expectation management and how to present these to patients in a positive manner. d.

Further, I have concerns about the implementation and embedding of the lessons learned which are identified by the SI Report. In this case, the live witnesses who gave evidence during the course of the inquest did not demonstrate that learning had filtered down to the front-line staff. I am therefore concerned that the SI process at LPT does not support a robust and critical analysis and investigation of the care provided to patients. Further, I have concerns about the ability of the Trust to embed changes and learning. This failure to properly explore matters and learn where possible inevitably leads to a delay, or failure altogether, to learn lessons which are vital to patient safety across the whole Trust.'],\n",

A: Yes\". The summary of the incident on page 4 was only partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated the individual: \"decided to jump down onto the tracks to take their own life but then changed their mind and came back onto the platform\". The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example, the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police). The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to the individual. Their report stated: \"Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with their family\".

The Coroner heard evidence and accepts that this is a complex issue in that informal patients are entitled to their liberty while at the same time potentially presenting a risk of harming themselves. The Coroner is concerned – particularly given the complexity of this issue – that there is no written policy or guidance on it aside from a short paragraph within the Trust’s policy governing leave for detained patients. In particular, there appears to be no clear written policy/procedure on the following: - The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients request to leave the unit; - The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent observations when they request to leave the unit; - The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too high risk to leave the unit; - The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients do leave the unit; - The recording of assessments and decisions related to requests made by informal patients to leave the unit; - The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. While the inquest into the death was concerned with the policies in place for informal patients, the Coroner is not aware of a clear timeframe for reporting detained patients either, and consideration should be given to introducing a clear timeframe for detained patients as well. Consideration should also be given to ensuring that all staff are fully trained and competent in any new policies and/or procedures introduced in relation to the matters set out above. During the course of the inquest, the court also heard that following the death, SABP carried out a Serious Incident investigation which resulted in the following recommendation, ‘To develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring, and how to manage leave requests during treatment.’ The court heard that a protocol has been developed to manage the medical aspects of alcohol detoxification but does not cover care plans, minimum monitoring, or the management of leave requests during treatment.

Requests were made by email and CAD, without discussions between officers. This was confirmed in the evidence, which stated that from their perspective there was a lack of feedback to manage expectations regarding a search. In respect of the initial search, this meant that they did not advise that they considered the search request unfeasible given the extent of land outlined and the limitations on searching wooded areas during winter night hours. In respect of the request for a further search with more precise location details provided, not all of the information available regarding family and friends potentially being able to assist in finding the location based upon where the individual used to visit was disclosed.

An officer recorded on the CAD that until the transfer document was received, they were unable to arrange a search or contact the specialist search team. Whilst it was given in evidence that there is awareness of a review of guidance around tasking and transfers between bordering Police forces, at present there appears to be no requirement for appropriate Police Officers to make telephone contact between forces to ensure effective tasking and transferring, in addition to the required written requests.

From the evidence, it is clear that an enormous burden of responsibility and reliance is placed on the individual Care Coordinator as they are expected to be the conduit of information to other professionals and to continuously review and assess all areas of the patient’s needs and to call in others as required. I concluded that the only person who had the ability to have a comprehensive view of the patient’s mental health was the Care Coordinator and the quality of the information provided to others within the multi-disciplinary team and other agencies was entirely dependent on the ability, availability, resources, experience, training, and skills of the Care Coordinator.',\n",

I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfill care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in their evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst they were able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, they were unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and were unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.

       " 11: ['During the inquest, evidence was heard that: Nursing staff and Health Care Assistants on Westleigh Ward at Atherleigh Park Hospital were carrying out (and continue to carry out) observations of patients at precise intervals (for example, if a patient is on half-hourly observations, staff explained that they would aim to carry out observations at 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, etc.). Further, all records showed that the timings of observations were at precise intervals. This is not in accordance with the Trust’s policy of observations (which confirms that observations should be irregular but within the (e.g., 30-minute) window. The reason for this policy is clearly to avoid a situation whereby a patient can predict when they will next be observed (and offer an opportunity for the patient to take action to harm themselves during that period of time).',\n",
       "  'Observation Policy At the time of the incident, observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at that time did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing. Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient. Inmind Healthcare Group’s new observation policy states: ‘Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice……. Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us’. Changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (e.g., hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour). Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice. However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording. This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded.',\n",
       "  'At the time they sought to strangle themselves with a cord, they were an informal patient at the Conway Ward, a mental health facility. At the inquest, evidence was heard from a number of members of staff regarding what constitutes an effective observation. They were the subject of what were described as Safety and Security [SAS] and general observations, the completion of which was the responsibility of a number of members of care staff. The evidence heard from staff raised an area of concern because that evidence indicated quite clearly that there was a lack of consistency and clarity regarding what constitutes an effective observation. An independent expert witness indicated in a report that they completed prior to the inquest that they felt custom and practice was such that some staff were merely checking on the “whereabouts” of the patient. Some staff felt that they were expected to enter the room of the patient and to try to engage with them and to check the room environment for anything that may pose a risk to them. Others felt that whether they were expected to actually enter a patient’s room to conduct the observation could vary depending on the level of risk a particular patient presented; in other words, they felt they had an element of discretion regarding whether they entered the room. This evidence appeared to be in contrast to a Trust policy. In the case of the patient, as can be seen above, they had limited understanding of English, and a number of staff gave evidence that they remained in their room throughout their time on the Conway Ward and did not wish to engage with them. Nevertheless, the author of the Trust’s Sudden Untoward Incident Review document agreed that there was no such discretion and that staff ought to enter the room to complete an effective observation. At the conclusion of the inquest, I expressed the view that I was concerned that there is a risk of future deaths because staff remain unclear about what amounts to an effective observation, and more specifically whether there are circumstances which may allow them to refrain from verbally engaging with a patient, or from physically entering a patient’s room to check the environment, and that should that lack of consistency and clarity prevail, other patients may be placed at risk as a result of inadequate observations. For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I am of the opinion that the above concern remains valid despite the fact that further to the patient’s death, the provision of mental health care for patients such as them has moved from the Conway Ward to another facility within my jurisdiction at which members of staff who were working at the time of the patient’s death continue to be employed in a similar capacity.'],\n",
       " 12: ['ACCT documents in evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorized risk based on ‘remaining’ risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger. This leads me to have two concerns: The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was provided some time after the death and well after the disruptions brought about by the pandemic. I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a ‘whole prison’ document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff. There was no joint training for prison and healthcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since).',\n",
       "  'The next case review was scheduled; however, this did not take place, and there was no further case review prior to their death. The evidence did not reveal why this had not taken place. As the ACCT is a paper-based system, a missed case review is not automatically flagged in any way. Since their death, there has been the implementation of the ACCT assurance process nationally, which requires the ACCT paperwork to be reviewed on three occasions as quality assurance or audit. Firstly, between 25 and 72 hours of the ACCT being opened, secondly at day 7 of the ACCT being opened, and finally at the post-closure review. If a person is subject to an ACCT for a lengthy period of time, there is a gap between day 7 and the post-closure review where no quality assurance is required to be undertaken. Their key worker gave evidence that in an ideal world, prison officers would sit down with a prisoner for 45 minutes once a week to undertake key work as per national guidance. They explained that the two key work sessions they had with the individual lasted no more than 5 minutes and were conducted on the landing outside their cell while other people would be walking around the wing. This was due to the fact the officer had to run the wing at the same time, and they therefore explained the key work sessions were not effective. They confirmed that the key work sessions they undertake now with prisoners would probably be no more than 15 minutes. They further confirmed they were not invited to any of the 11 ACCT case reviews and to date have never been invited to any ACCT reviews for any prisoner, even as a prisoner’s key worker. There is inequity in the system in that if a person is deemed detainable under the Mental Health Act in the community, they will be admitted to hospital straight away. If there is no bed available in a psychiatric unit, they will be placed in an acute hospital where there is monitoring and access to medical care 24 hours a day. If a person is in need of hospital care and treatment under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act, there are delays in the transfer to a hospital setting. When a prisoner suffers a physical health problem, they can be transferred to hospital for care by ambulance or escort. With a mental health care problem, the appropriate paperwork needs to be completed, a hospital bed found, and arrangements made for transfer before a person is admitted to hospital. During this time, a prisoner may be placed in a prison without a healthcare unit and without 24-hour healthcare monitoring and care. The current legal timeframe for this is within 28 days. In relation to the individual, their transfer would have been completed 26 days after they were first assessed. Several witnesses said this was one of the quickest transfers they had experienced. When a code blue or code red is called, evidence was given that the control room does not automatically call an ambulance and before doing so, asks questions such as whether the patient is conscious and breathing. Annex A of Prison Service Instruction (PSI) requires an ambulance to be called automatically as a mandatory contingency response upon a code blue or red being called, and directs staff to await updates from the scene. This PSI is not currently being followed. The individual did not have any contact with their family and when their family was told of their death, they thought it was a mistake as they thought the individual was still at another facility. They had been writing to the individual through the email a prisoner service. There was no evidence their correspondence had reached the individual. Email a prisoner is based on the person in the community who wants to contact the prisoner entering the prisoner’s location in the prison estate, rather than their unique prison number. If the location is wrong or the prisoner has been moved, the prisoner will not receive the contact. The individual told prison staff during their induction and the ACCT assessment that they were in contact with their family and used their parents for support. Familial contact can be a key protective factor in the management of a person’s mental health. In the personal information section of their NOMIS records, they were recorded as having no next of kin. There is no record the contact details of their next of kin were discussed with them. This evidences missed opportunities to involve the individual’s family in their care and management prior to their death. Evidence was given that at the time if there was no next of kin recorded for a prisoner, a monthly report would reveal this and prisoners would be spoken to about this. There is no record the individual was spoken to about this, and it did not appear from the prison there was a clear process as to how next of kin is detailed or checked.',\n",
       "  \"Joint training is provided, and this is reassuring. However, I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest. The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager advised that they had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of their ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on an individual and the apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents, the quality of the audits is brought into question. Information sharing. In evidence, it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne, which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS, which healthcare staff do not have access to. Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings. In addition, a decision relating to an individual's care (i.e., the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff. Those representing informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers, and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT, and any relevant information is shared via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS, and the multidisciplinary team. They could not assist me with whether this was an initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate. My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered. Cells within the area considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff as the ‘mental health’ cells have 2 cells that are not equipped in a way to reduce the number of available ligature points. It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move an individual to the ‘mental health cells’ simply due to the fact they were on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. It was informed to me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition, I was informed that all telephone points in the ‘mental health cells’ have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments. However, at inquest, those representing could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self-harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by the design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so. I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells that prison and healthcare staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self-harm. The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However, certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that there are high levels of self-harm and suicide, and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN.

       " 13: ['It was the evidence of the author of the EPUT Root Cause Analysis Investigation Report that, while all the other EPUT teams that came into contact with the individual, such as the Mental Health Liaison Team and the Street Triage Team, used the same software called Mobius to record, access, and share important information and developments regarding the individual, one team, namely the Health and Justice Team, did not use this software and instead used software that was incapable of being accessed by the other teams. A consequence of this was that the other teams were wholly unaware of crises and other important information regarding the individual’s mental health that were known to the Health and Justice Team.',\n",
       "  \"Initial referral – there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from a family at the point of referral and admission. A family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someone's care. Access to notes - the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessibility of notes for continuity of care. This is pertinent, given that often mental health patients may be under the care of various service providers concurrently and it is critical that comprehensive information is available to all involved in the care process. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual's notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individual's risk assessment and their subsequent care plan.\",\n",
       "  \"The first is as follows: I am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team, neither team is able to access the other team's records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating teams means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters, which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis - such as substance misuse and mental health - given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual. I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing risk.\"],\n",

The NHS is offering this support, if needed, through local Children and Young People Mental Health services (CYPMH), also known as Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). People will be contacted to ask if they are happy for their details to be shared with their local CYPMH / CAMH service so they can speak to a professional about how they are feeling.

Their parents did everything they could during this period to support them, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly their mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and they took their own life. Initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner. I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services, but there were many failings in the care provided. It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant underfunding of the local mental health Trust, which, like many mental health Trusts, has seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services (CAMHS).

The nurse spoke to the patient, who denied making a ligature. The patient's neck was examined, and she had no marks from ligature use. The shoelaces from one pair of shoes were removed, but other shoelaces, clothing, and bedding were left in her possession as it was felt that she was not at immediate risk. She was not believed to be at immediate risk because, while it was a feature of her mental state common to many patients that she would regularly talk about not wanting to live and requesting an overdose, there was no evidence that she had made an active suicide attempt, and she had no history of suicide or self-harm attempts. The fact that she was now saying that she had attempted to make a ligature was a change in her presentation (her previous suicidal ideation had centered around requesting assistance to overdose). It was also of significance that she was saying one thing to her family and something different to a clinician. BSMHT accepted that the information was significant and therefore there ought to have been consideration of it by her treating team with a review of her risk and observation levels. However, no record at all was made of the family's concerns and the account given by the patient. Her risk screen was not updated, an incident report was not raised, and the information was not included in handover to the next shift or at the next MDT.

       "  'The evidence in this inquest was that Cygnet’s Ligature Risk Reduction Policy and the Ligature Audit Tool/Ligature Risk Assessment are standard documents used by Mental Health inpatient providers, including NHS Psychiatric Trusts. The Ligature Risk Reduction Policy quotes the CQC guidance that “Three-quarters of people who kill themselves whilst on a psychiatric ward do so by hanging or strangulation.” Whilst these documents provide detailed guidance in respect of minimizing ligature anchor points, they do not give guidance as to minimizing potential ligatures themselves, which are defined as “Any item which can be used to make a loop or noose with the intention of limiting the supply of oxygen to an individual by hanging or asphyxiation.” Rather than emphasizing the very real risk that specific items of clothing can pose to vulnerable patients, the document places emphasis on avoiding ‘blanket restrictions,’ which does not assist in identifying where the real risks lie. Death by the use of a ligature is likely to occur within a few minutes, whereas observations for a high-risk patient not assessed as being in immediate crisis will generally be carried out four times in every hour, which therefore provides only a limited degree of risk reduction. Consideration should be given as to the efficacy of such a policy and whether this can be improved by recognizing that some items of clothing will be more obvious ligature risks and may need to be removed in all cases.

       " 18: ['They were diagnosed as being autistic with a designation of Asperger’s Syndrome. They were also diagnosed as experiencing Bipolar Disorder, an attribution they did not accept, which they repeatedly asserted to both previous mental health care providers and the subsequent clinicians tasked with supporting them at the time of their death. They insisted their difficulties were linked to their autism and not a mental disorder. It was accepted that they experienced autism and that was part of their individuality, and that in addition, they may have had a mental health disorder. It was accepted that their care and treatment cannot unbundle the two, but they should be treated holistically. Assessment and formulation of risks and safety summary did not fully explore the impact of their autism. There was little to suggest that staff a) considered the higher prevalence of suicide for individuals with a diagnosis of autism and b) that they may have communicated their distress and risks information differently to an individual without a diagnosis of autism during their periods of crisis or increased risk, and c) made sufficient reasonable adjustments in relation to the impact of their autism. TEWV had progressed from a low baseline in their work to address perceived underdevelopment in their services for the autistic patient when presenting with a mental health disorder. They had expanded the use of a specialist team to extend their work into the North Yorkshire caseload. The steps taken were incremental, and not all staff understood that team and access to that important resource. It is recognized that improvements would take time and be resource dependent as well. APT has three specialist and autism dedicated practitioners working exclusively with autism across the whole Trust in both its regions of commissioned care, although there are also non-dedicated clinicians with some expertise in autism within TEWV. TEWV does not treat autism in North Yorkshire. TEWV in its recent audit indicates about 17% of the individuals open to them have an autism marker, i.e., have an ICD-10 diagnosis of autism or experience suspected/confirmed autism or have a referral including being suspected as autistic. There was no direct causation to the suicide found that directly attributed the acts taken to their autism from the evidence. However, their distress and stressors before their death included feelings that they were not getting what they saw to be the right help and that they would not lose their feelings of helplessness such that they took their own life. The concern is that the very significant number of those open to TEWV with an autism marker has increased and will continue to do so, and that the higher prevalence of suicide within that expanding group will lead to higher risk of, and numbers of, autistic individuals dying because of suicide both within the locality but also nationally. Urgent solutions are required to prevent further deaths of autistic individuals, especially those with a mental health disorder, by rapidly improving and expanding provisions for assessment and management of risk of harm to themselves for individuals within the autism spectrum while presenting with a mental health disorder.',\n",
       "  \"In removing reference to EUPD, which had been discounted, all of which added to her distress. These actions and inactions destroyed her relationship with community mental health clinicians, and she did not trust them enough to try to restore any effective care relationship. She suffered repeated trauma derived from her autistic condition, revisiting the causes of her distress, which she re-experienced time and again with ‘film reel’ recollection. That trauma was again not understood. In short, her autism (and thus risk assessment) was misunderstood by the clinicians tasked to keep her safe. TEWV's provision for care of autistic conditions was underdeveloped, reflecting a national want of provision, to include: A no multidisciplinary clinical assessment and formulation addressed her autism; B no reasonable adjustments were then made in terms of her sensory and environmental needs in any timely fashion, or at all; C no person-centred (thus autism-centred) holistic plan was developed to work in partnership that took account of her autism and her gender. As the evidence revealed, one “cannot uncouple autism and other psychological/psychiatric experiences.” Instead, she withdrew from engagement with TEWV community health clinicians. D there was no local provision within TEWV for specialist autism assessment and adapted psychological therapy. Commissioned providers of these essential cares were outwith TEWV, requiring specific Funding Request (which was granted) for a course of assessment and therapy. Those providers did not offer statutory acute mental health services support, including out-of-hours/crisis support. TEWV did not provide what the commissioned providers were supplying. There was a want of effective communications between these ‘teams,’ not least as patient data was not accessible by one to the others' electronic records (patient consent permitting) and the fact of disengagement. There was a sense of ‘silo’ working, militating against partnership working, that encouraged unfavourably the undesirable “uncoupling” of experiences; E statistical evidence indicated that autistic individuals are more at risk of suicide than those with no neurodevelopmental condition, and females at greater risk than their male counterparts; F there was a clinical (but not measured) experience that more patients were presenting to the statutory service with autistic conditions, and it follows, more patients would be at risk of suicide; G she was detained under ss 2/3 MHA 1983 17 times and presented to A and E around 37 times with evident self-harm and apparent attempts on her life. She repeated high-risk behaviours. She had no Care Co-ordinator nor effective Care Plan (which ought to have been in place) because she had not engaged with TEWV community services; H she lurched from crisis to crisis, remaining at high risk to her own safety; she died because she could no longer cope with the sense of injustice caused by others that overwhelmed her thinking. She felt she was not being listened to by community mental health services. Her therapy from outside providers, which was proving helpful to her, was disrupted by limitations on face-to-face consultations; both locally, including regionally, but also nationally, the evidence revealed a number of serious issues that require urgent and immediate action to support autistic people well, not just from a sensory and environmental basis (which TEWV has started to improve albeit from a low baseline according to the evidence received).

This is a national problem and sadly leads to many experiencing unnecessary admissions to inpatient mental health facilities and also A&E attendances. Despite a report from the Health and Social Care committee, this case showed that there does not seem to have been any real improvement and more lives are likely to be lost. Reading from this report, it says, “The conclusion of this report was that Autistic people (and people with learning disabilities) have the right to live independent, free, and fulfilled lives in the community and it is an unacceptable violation of their human rights to deny them the chance to do so.” The report identified that “the community support and provision for autistic people (and those with learning difficulties) and financial investment in those services is significantly below the level required to meet the needs of those individuals and to provide adequate support for them in the community.” The Inquest heard that there still remains an acute shortage of provision. Evidence was heard that a local council had tried over 30 providers to help put in place support for an individual but they could not find a placement for her, so the only provision that they were able to offer her was supported housing with temporary care agency staff. This provision broke down, which exacerbated her mental health. This then led to a hospital mental inpatient admission.'],\n",

Whilst this distance is likely to deter a patient of any age from accepting the offer, it is particularly problematic for elderly patients and their families. c. Whilst remedial action is underway in response to the concerns raised in the reports issued, currently it still remains the position that at least one patient every day in Birmingham and Solihull is advised they require an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment but no bed is available within the area.',\n",
       "  'In evidence, it was heard that an individual had not received their ‘depot’ medication for some time and was clearly suffering from a psychotic episode at the time of their assessment at the Accident and Emergency department of the West Suffolk Hospital. They told staff they were not actively suicidal at that point in time, and although the staff were concerned about their presentation, under mental health law least restrictive principles, they did not believe the powers of detention under the Mental Health Act were applicable. That said, it was also clear from the evidence that the mental health personnel who saw the individual wanted to immediately admit them as an informal patient. It was also clear that when the individual attended hospital, they too wanted to be immediately admitted as an informal patient. As a result, staff tried to locate a bed for the individual so they could be admitted as all involved wished. However, it was identified that there were no beds available in Suffolk, or anywhere else in the country at the time. Different options of keeping the individual in the hospital were explored but none were viable. As such, they were prescribed medication to reduce their immediate anxiety and sent home with a friend, with instructions to return if their symptoms deteriorated. The individual took their own life the next morning before they could be returned to hospital. Had a bed been available and the individual had been admitted as they and medical staff had wished, their death would not have occurred. I am therefore concerned in relation to the overall bed capacity for those patients seeking informal admission. In addition, I am concerned about the provisions to temporarily house a patient wishing informal admission in the circumstances that a bed is not immediately available.'],\n",

It was not clear when and how often risk assessments should be updated and how and when they would be read in conjunction with the progress notes.

Further, the evidence was that rather than being used for a detailed assessment per the indicators set out in the tool at the time of each relevant event, it was reviewed to instead access any past assessment in order only to establish quickly a benchmark against which to gauge a patient’s current presentation when considering their risks. The detailed indicators informing the risk assessment were not updated. Although it was submitted that patient risk was nonetheless assessed and recorded in the EPJS, and it was acknowledged that benchmarking/comparison is useful, I am concerned that:'],\n",

       "  'The inquest heard evidence of the distress caused to individuals and the impact on their health by the long waits to be seen by gastroenterologists and gynaecologists within the NHS. The evidence heard was that post-Covid, the waiting times to be seen in both specialties, unless the referral was on the two-week cancer wait, had grown significantly across England. As an illustration, the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England, the wait was often in excess of 12 months. Even an urgent referral would often involve a wait of over 40 weeks. This was leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment even in those with significant or severe health conditions.'],\n",
       " 22: ['BSMHFT utilizes self-contained specialist teams. They were treated by (a) crisis team/home treatment team, (b) community mental health team, and (c) psychiatric liaison team. The evidence demonstrated that communication between the specialist teams was not effective, and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse who reviewed them updated the community mental health team. However, the GP could not prescribe their medication because it had not been approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA, and they went without their medication. The GP had to contact the community mental health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurse’s involvement. They cited this delay as making their mental health worse shortly before their death. My concern is that communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFT’s RCA action plan is to seek assurance from the CCG/ICB that communication between the specialist teams is being strengthened. My concern is that this does not go far enough and there should be consideration of a formal process or policy.',\n",
       "  'When they were taken to the hospital, they explained that they had been back and forth from the railway station. They were discharged with a plan for follow-up by the community mental health team (CMHT). I was told that the local CMHT meets at the beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an appointment is made, so it was likely that they would have to wait an absolute minimum of a week to be seen. In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer them to the crisis team. Their family knew nothing of their mental ill health. They declined an invitation by the nurse assessing them to contact their family. They did not want to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic benefits of the input of a patient’s loved ones, the assessing nurse did not in any way try to persuade them to allow her to do this. The first that their family heard of their mental ill health was when they heard of their death. I am sure that, had they been made aware of it while they were still alive, they would have done everything in their power to support them and to engage with the mental health services. Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services have not done enough to try to bring them into a patient’s care. In spite of the frequency of this occurrence, the lesson does not seem to be being learned. When you respond to this letter, I should be grateful to know not just what you have done to address the issue in your own trust, but also what you have done to raise national awareness.',\n",
       "  'The evidence I heard was that the café71 service is run as a crisis line for those who are in ‘lesser crisis’ than those who would call the mental health team crisis line or the crisis resolution home treatment team. It appears that the café71 team is operating in isolation, separately from the mental health team, and for those patients who are under the mental health team, they will be unaware of the background and the risk factors for that person. They will take an assessment of that person at face value based on how they are in the call, as they don’t have access to the information held by the mental health team. In addition, there does not appear to be any notification to the mental health team to say that the person has been in contact such that this can be followed up. It is likely that there is notification to the GP, but in this case, there was no detail provided which could have been passed on, and the timescales for review of correspondence by the GP, who again are operating somewhat in isolation from the mental health team, do not lend themselves to the prompt action which may be required by the mental health team. I am concerned that the lack of information sharing between the organisations, and in particular in real time or as near as possible, gives rise to a risk of future deaths and consider that your organisation has the power to take action, either as provider of the service or as commissioner.'],\n",

The decision that the student could re-take the fourth year of their medical degree was seen by the medical school as a helpful decision. The re-take was allowed on the basis of their ill health and was not a criticism of their academic achievement. That they would not be able to take their fourth year examinations in August came to be regarded as almost self-evident, because they had not been able to attend the majority of their recent clinical placement and had been so recently so unwell. However, unbeknown to the university staff, the student appears to have lacked some insight at this point and was actually hoping not to have to re-take the year, but instead to take their fourth year exams in August.',\n",
