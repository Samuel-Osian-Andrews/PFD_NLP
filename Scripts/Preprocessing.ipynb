      "ORIGINAL DATA:  During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) The gatekeeping assessment included a mental health state examination, where it was the clinical opinion of the mental health practitioner from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team, that Ms Morris required an inpatient hospital admission to a mental health ward as there was an immediate risk to her safety as she was found to be a high risk of walking in front of a car. Whilst Ms Morris agreed to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and Regulation 28 – After Inquest Document Template Updated 30/07/2021 Emergency Department or to remain in the community whilst waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris had been informed that if she attended the Accident and Emergency Department, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris did not wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that Ms Morris would stay overnight with a family member, and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for Ms Morris to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep her safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts as there is a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds. I am therefore concerned that there is a risk of future deaths as it is not possible to access inpatient mental health beds at the time of clinical need.\n",

    "It's useful to use word embeddings prior to topic modelling in order to capture semantic similarity between certain words. For example, words like 'medicine', 'drugs' and 'prescription' would all be treated independently if we did not use embeddings, despite them having similar meanings. Note that we would not have this issue for models such as BERTopic which use their own embeddings.\n",
    "\n",

    "Below we use a pre-trained Word2Vec model from Gensim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we scan for **out-of-vocabulary (OOV)** words. These are words contained within our PFD data that are *not* also contained within our pre-trained model. Where this occurs, this is mostly due to spelling mistakes, specialised terminology, or acronyms. Embeddings vector must be identical in dimension to our word tokens. As a crude solution to OOV words - which our Word2Vec model cannot numerically represent - we assign these words the average of all scores contained within each respective report."
