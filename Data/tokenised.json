Mental Health. Mr Larsen reported going through a very difficult time, his business was beingliquidated and he felt he had let his family and business associates down. Mr Larsen advised the GP that he had placed a bag over his head a few days before the consultation but stopped short of seeing his attempt to end his life through because he thought about his children who were a protective factor for him. Mr Larsen\u2019s GP referred him to the CRISIS Home Resolution Treatment Team, part of the Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust, who accepted him for a period of treatment. Mr Larsen was seen regularly by the team and commenced on medication. Mr Larsen was discharged from the CRISIS Home Resolution Treatment Team on 3 December 2022. On 4 January 2023 Mr Larsen contacted the CRISIS Home Resolution Treatment Team and reported a return of suicidal thoughts, he said that he felt he needed medication, counselling and mental health support. Mr Larsen agreed to be contacted by a Mental Health Practitioner from the Mental Health Central Access Point for the purposes of carrying out a triage. On 5 January 2023, in the evening, a Nurse from the Mental Health Central Access Point contacted Mr Larsen to carry out a Safe and Well Call. During the call Mr Larsen confirmed that he was ok and agreed for the triage appointment to be carried out on 6 January 2023, confirming that he would be able to keep himself safe until then. It was accepted during the inquest by the Nurse who undertook this safe and well call that she had not read Mr Larsen\u2019s medical records or his referral document before making the safe and well call and therefore she was not aware of the risks relating to Mr Larsen when she made the call. On 6 January 2023 Mr Larsen was found hanging at home by his wife, he died before the planned triage call could take place. Concerns 1. Multi-Disciplinary Team (\u201cMDT\u201d) Meetings I am concerned about the Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust MDT meetings and their functionality. Mr Larsen was discussed at three meetings, at two of the three meetings none of the attendees had met Mr Larsen. It was at an MDT meeting where Mr Larsen was deemed to be \u201clow risk\u201d (having initially been deemed to be high risk by the Central Access Point), it is not possible to understand why Mr Larsen\u2019s risk was downgraded to low risk by the MDT meeting because the MDT meeting documentation does not contain that information. The issue of poor documentation relating to MDT meetings and their decision making is something which could have ramifications across the whole Trust and also for other bodies who come together to provide care for patients. The MDT meeting either misread or misunderstood Mr Larsen\u2019s medical records. The notes document that Mr Larsen explained that he had previously placed a bag over his head and that this remained the way he would end his life, he advised that he could not give assurances that he would not try to do this again. The MDT documentation however states that Mr Larsen \u201cwrapped plastic bag over his face but self-rescued, does not want to do it again\u201d. This is incorrect. The MDT meeting therefore proceeded, and made decisions based upon, incorrect information. There were several requests made to MDT meetings for Mr Larsen to have a medic review, the MDT  deemed this to be unnecessary but there is no documentation explaining the rationale of those decision. The Trust SI report states that \u201cit is unfortunate that he was not reviewed by a medic.\u201d At the second MDT meeting on 17th November the working diagnosis in relation to Mr Larsen was an acute stress reaction. This working diagnosis was not revisited at the third MDT on 22nd November. The Trust\u2019s SI report states that by 17th November there was evidence of a severe depressive disorder, this potential diagnosis was not identified or explored by the MDT meeting. 2. Risk assessments At his initial triage (undertaken by the Central Access Point) Mr Larsen was deemed to be high risk. At a later MDT meeting Mr Larsen was deemed to be low risk. It is not possible to explore the rationale behind the downgrading of Mr Larsen\u2019s risk to low because there is no documentation about the decision making. The Trust\u2019s SI report identified the fact that several \u201cred flag\u201d risk factors which applied to Mr Larsen were not \u201crobustly considered\u201d when assessing Mr Larsen\u2019s risk. The Trust\u2019s SI report states that it was \u201cunclear why it was felt the risks had subsided by the time of discharge on 3.12.2022\u201d. 3. Discharge Mr Larsen was discharged from the care of LPT on 3 December 2022, there was no planned support for Mr Larsen post-discharge other than some counselling which was due to start three weeks later. The Trust\u2019s SI report states that it is \u201cunclear why it was felt the risks had subsided by the time of discharge on 3.12.2022\u201d and that Mr Larsen had the \u201cpresence of ample markers for high risk of completed suicide\u201d yet he was discharged back to the care of his GP and into a lacuna of care with no pre-arranged support other than counselling which would not commence for three weeks. 4. The Serious Investigation and Reporting Process at LPT I remain concerned about inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust. The Serious Incident Investigation into Mr Larsen\u2019s death did uncover and accepted some failings in relation to the care provided to Mr Larsen. However, it failed to uncover all the matters arising at inquest and, some of the matters that it did uncover do not have correlating items of work listed in the action plan. There was no exploration of the MDT meeting\u2019s functionality or documentation as part of the SI investigation. Further, I have concerns about the implementation and embedding of the lessons learned which are identified by the SI Report. In this case the live witnesses who gave evidence during the course of the inquest did not demonstrate that learning had filtered down to the front-line staff. I am therefore concerned that the SI process at LPT does not support a robust and critical analysis and investigation of the care provided to patients, further, I have concerns about the ability of the Trust to embed changes and learning. This failure to properly explore matters and learn where possible inevitably leads to a delay, or failure altogether, to learn lessons which are vital to patient safety across the whole Trust.

principal concern is that when a high-risk mental health patient is missing it requires effective and meaningful multi-agency co-ordination. Locally, it engages BSMHFT\u2019s Missing Patient Policy (which purports to append WMP\u2019s missing person procedures), national College of Policing: Missing Person Authorised Professional Practice (\u2018APP\u2019), and National Partnership Agreement: Right Care, Right Person (\u2018RCRP\u2019). The evidence revealed significant gaps in knowledge, co-ordination and application of these policies. Specifically: (1) I am not reassured BSMHFT staff are handing attending police officers \u2018appendix C \u2013 risk rating\u2019 as required by their missing person policy. I am not reassured WMP officers are aware they should be provided with \u2018appendix C \u2013 risk rating\u2019. Context: I did not accept the Nurse-in- Charge routinely used \u2018appendix C \u2013 risk rating\u2019, and police witnesses - including a Locate Sergeant, and the Head of Locate, a Detective Chief Inspector - indicated they had never seen \u2018appendix C \u2013 risk rating\u2019. (2) A \u2018monitoring tool\u2019 in the BMSHFT Missing Patient Policy requires routine monitoring to ensure nurses are completing \u2018appendix A\u2019 and \u2018appendix B\u2019, but not \u2018appendix C \u2013 risk rating\u2019. Context: I was told this is under review, however I was concerned this is still outstanding 9 months following the death. (3) I am not reassured BSMHFT Clinical Service Managers (\u2018CSMs\u2019) are (a) coordinating the attempts to locate high-risk missing patients, and (b) inviting a representative from WMP to attend \u2018daily appraisal\u2019 meetings to discuss the high-risk missing patient\u2019s absence as required by their missing patient policy. I am not reassured WMP officers are aware this is the CSM\u2019s role and of the expectation of being invited to a \u2018daily appraisal\u2019. Context: this process did not happen in Mr Bari\u2019s case, and the WMP\u2019s Head of Locate said she was not aware of the police ever being invited by a CSM to attend a \u2018daily appraisal\u2019. (4) I am not reassured the RCRP \u2018challenge\u2019 process has been effectively communicated to BSMHFT. Context: I was told by WMP\u2019s Head of Locate there has been an agreed \u2018challenge\u2019 process to WMP\u2019s decision on risk category since February 2024, albeit BSMHFT have never used it. However, I heard from BSMHFT\u2019s Head of Acute Nursing that there was no such process. Further, she explained ongoing frustration bearing in mind BSMHFT\u2019s expertise, that WMP often do not accept BSMHFT\u2019s reported high-risk category, WMP often do not communicate they have not accepted it with BSMHFT only finding out much later, and WMP often close missing patient investigations without informing BSMHFT. (5) The BSMHFT Missing Person Policy purports to append WMP\u2019s missing person process but makes no mention of RCRP. I am not reassured the BSMHFT Missing Person Policy is therefore accurate and up-to-date. (6) RCRP does not require WMP to formally indicate to BSMHFT (i.e. via a form) when the police have taken a different view about the risk category. BSMHFT will often be unaware of the different view taken by the police rendering the \u2018challenge\u2019 process redundant and reducing the chances of the police identifying they have overlooked key information. (7) The BSMHFT Missing Patient Policy and RCRP do not require BSMHFT to hand attending constables a copy of the risk assessment, or require attending constables, or later the Locate team, to request a copy of the risk assessment. In the event of a conflict about risk category, requiring attending constables to take early possession of the written risk assessment may lead to the police identifying they have overlooked key information and revisit their own risk category. (8) RCRP and APP do not require attending constables to have particular regard to the expertise of mental health clinicians and hesitate or be extra vigilant before rejecting their opinion on risk category. RCRP and APP appear to regard reports from mental health clinicians no differently to those from members of the public, and family and friends of the missing person. Context: police witnesses agreed that BSMHFT clinicians were the experts on mental health diagnosis, including identifying those conditions that carry an increased risk of suicide, and assessing the risk of suicide generally.

No evidence was seen that recipients of a \u2018Claires Law\u2019 Domestic Violence Disclosure are treated as being of greater vulnerability, or at a higher risk, when Child Services are undertaking investigations regarding the provision of children\u2019s care, and removal of the children from a parent is being considered. evidence that the Social Worker appointed to this case, quite properly focussed on what was in the best interest of Kate\u2019s children. There was however no formal system in place to provide additional support for Kate herself, even though she was known to be vulnerable. 2. It was identified that when Kate was informed there may be an application to the Family Court to place her children into care (using the Public Law Outline process), the impact of such a decision on her mental health, or physical wellbeing was not taken into consideration. As a recipient of a \u2018Claires Law\u2019 Domestic Violence Disclosure, it was acknowledged that she was of greater vulnerability, but no system is currently in place which allows a risk assessment to be undertaken at the time the Public Law Outline notification is given to a parent. The day after Kate was told of the Public Law Outline notification, she intentionally crashed her car in an unsuccessful attempt to end her life, requiring 4 weeks in an Intensive Treatment Unit to recover from the serious injuries she received. 3. Once the Public Law Outline process was initiated, independent legal advice was provided, and a voluntary sector advocate supported Kate through the legal process. However, Katie received no independent support from Social Services, and had no independent professional to undertake a holistic review of her case, in light of her known circumstances and vulnerabilities. It was heard that mental health professionals had assumed Kate had a Social Worker of her own, and expressed surprise when finding out that she did not. 4. Safeguarding referrals made the Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub in respect of Kate\u2019s children were viewed in isolation, with no system in place to the assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself. There were no additional steps, or risk assessments undertaken in relation to Kate, even though she was a recipient of a \u2018Claires Law\u2019 Domestic Violence Disclosure and therefore known to be more vulnerable. 5. In 2022 it was recognised by a Clinical Psychologist that Kate could benefit from Schema-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, which is not routinely available on the NHS. The psychological review had been ordered by the Family Court, and funding for this course needed to be applied for. Applying for funding involved requests to the Legal Aid Board, Integrated Care Board (Individual Funding Request), Wellbeing Service and Social Services, none of whom provided the funding, with each suggesting contacting one of the other agencies involved. An experienced mental health clinician with many years\u2019 experience described the \u2018whole route as very complicated\u2019 and \u2018it was difficult to find a solution for funding\u2019. In addition, funding was very rarely made available, and as a service they were usually unable to meet patient expectations (who believe a treatment might be made available), where in reality it

During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. On the 4th June 2021 Frazer, was placed at HMP Lewes where he remained until his release on the 4th October 2021 having served a sentence of imprisonment. On the 7th October 2021, he was remanded into custody and placed at HMP Winchester. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the 10th November 2021 and was due to be released on the 25th March 2022. ii. During his placement at HMP Lewes, Frazer presented with a deterioration in his mental health and remained subject to an ACCT due to an incident of self harm, and was also under the care of the healthcare team until the point of his release on the 4th October. iii. Following his arrival at HMP Winchester, which has a residential healthcare unit, referrals were made to the mental health team. Frazer was assessed by a psychiatrist on the 20th December 2021 who felt that he was suffering with enduring psychotic illness and required further review. iv. On the 14th January 2022 Frazer was transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. HMP Guys Marsh does not have a healthcare unit or a 24 hour in prison healthcare provision. The healthcare team operating hours are 7.30am to 6pm daily. v. An email was sent from the healthcare team at HMP Winchester to the healthcare team at HMP Guys Marsh with Frazer\u2019s name and that he was a person of interest. No other handover took place between the healthcare teams or the prison staff teams. vi. Following Frazer\u2019s transfer, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Guys Marsh raised an inappropriate transfer investigation as the clinical opinion was that he should not have been transferred to HMP Guys Marsh. Prior to Frazer\u2019s transfer, there had not been a discussion with the healthcare teams at HMP Winchester and Guys Marsh by the prison service to consider suitability of Frazer\u2019s transfer in view of the fact he was in the process of being assessed, and a confirmed diagnosis being made, relating to his mental health. vii. The Associate Medical Director for Practice Plus Group (PPG) who provided the healthcare at HMP Lewes and HMP Guys Marsh when Frazer was at those establishments, confirmed that there is no national directory that explains what healthcare facilities are 3 available at each prison and PPG have created one internally for the prisons they provide healthcare at. It was explained that this would assist when making decisions around suitability of location within the prison estate for prisoners, given their needs. Further if there was a national directory across all prisons this would greatly assist as PPG are only 1 of the 10 different healthcare providers across 114 prisons. He gave an example that he would not know how many disability access beds or cells there are at the prisons where PPG do not provide the healthcare. He also explained that there is no national specification in relation to healthcare units. viii. Frazer was a person with complex needs. His mental health deteriorated at HMP Guys Marsh. He would spend most of the time in his cell, he generally did not engage with staff or ACCT reviews, and there were records that he missed and secreted medication. He held delusionary beliefs that if his toilet was flushed or he watched television, his family would come to harm. His cell was in an extremely poor state, littered with rubbish, an unflushed toilet and a bucket which was used for him to urinate and defecate in. This bucket was found to be full in his cell at the time of his death. It was acknowledged by the staff at the time he was self neglecting and he was referred to the Safety Intervention Meeting (SIM) process on the 9th February 2022. The Head of Healthcare gave evidence that there was not an adequate plan between the prison and healthcare teams to manage Frazer\u2019s self neglect. ix. There is no national guidance on how to manage self neglect in prison. HMPPS are currently finalising a Social Care Learning Brief on Managing Self Neglect which is expected to be issued later this year, however there is no NHS guidance on this issue or joint guidance between HMPPS and NHS as to how to manage self neglect in a prison setting. x. Frazer\u2019s mental health deteriorated to such an extent that following an assessment on the 9th February 2022, he was deemed to require transfer to hospital under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The second doctor assessment was carried out the following day, 10th February 2022, and an application was sent to Ravenswood House Hospital, a secure unit within Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust on the 15th February 2022. Frazer was visited by the community psychiatrist on the 25th February 2022 when it was confirmed he required transfer to hospital for full assessment and treatment. The warrant was obtained from the Ministry of Justice for the transfer on the 1st March 2022. A bed was offered to HMP Guys Marsh by the hospital on the 1st March 2022 for admission on the 3rd March 2022, however, the prison could not facilitate an escort that day. The hospital could not facilitate safe admission on Friday 4th March 2022 or over the weekend, and the transfer was arranged for Monday 7th March 2022. Frazer was told on the 3rd March 4 2022 he would be transferred to hospital, however the evidence indicated he was not told when. At approximately 03.15am on the 7th March 2022 Frazer was found deceased in his cell, suspended by a ligature. xi. The ligature was made from a ripped bedsheet attached to the top corner of the cell door. The bedsheet was the same colour as the door and had not been seen prior to his death, and was therefore camouflaged. I refer to the attached photograph of the cell door which shows the ligature in place. The colour of the cell doors in each prison is directed by the Governor of the prison and not by national directive, however the same bedsheets are issued nationally across the prison estate. The similarity in colour could be a national issue and apply to other prisons. xii. An ACCT was opened in relation to Frazer on the 15th January 2022 and remained open until his death. Between 15th January and 7th March 2022 there were 11 case reviews. The ACCT records were incomplete and inadequate. The last case review took place on 1st March 2022. The next case review was scheduled for 3rd March 2022, however this did not take place and there was no further case review prior to Frazer\u2019s death. The evidence did not reveal why this had not taken place. As the ACCT is a paper based system, a missed case review is not automatically flagged in any way. xiii. Since Frazer\u2019s death there has been the implementation of the ACCT assurance process nationally which requires the ACCT paperwork to be reviewed on 3 occasions as quality assurance or audit. Firstly, between 25 and 72 hours of the ACCT being opened, secondly at day 7 of the ACCT being opened and finally at the post closure review. If a person is subject to an ACCT for a lengthy period of time, there is a gap between day 7 and the post closure review where no quality assurance is required to be undertaken. xiv. Frazer\u2019s key worker at HMP Guys Marsh gave evidence that in an ideal world prison officers would sit down with a prisoner for 45 minutes once a week to undertake key work as per national guidance. He explained that the 2 key work sessions he had with Frazer lasted no more than 5 minutes and were conducted on the landing outside his cell whilst other people would be walking around the wing. This was due to the fact the officer had to run the wing at the same time and he therefore explained the keywork sessions were not effective. He confirmed that the keywork sessions he undertakes now with prisoners now would probably be no more than 15 minutes. He further confirmed he was not invited to any of Frazer\u2019s 11 ACCT case reviews and to date he has never been invited to any ACCT reviews for any prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh, even as a prisoner\u2019s keyworker. xv. There is inequity in the system in that if a person is deemed 5 detainable under the Mental Health Act 1983 in the community, they will be admitted to hospital straight away. If there is no bed available in a psychiatric unit they will be placed in an acute hospital where there is monitoring and access to medical care 24 hours a day. If a person is in need of hospital care and treatment under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, there are delays in the transfer to a hospital setting. When a prisoner suffers a physical health problem they can be transferred to hospital for care by ambulance or escort. With a mental health care problem, the appropriate paperwork needs to be completed, a hospital bed found and arrangements made for transfer before a person is admitted to hospital. During this time a prisoner may be placed, as Frazer was, in a prison without a healthcare unit and without 24 hour healthcare monitoring and care. The current legal timeframe for this is within 28 days. In relation to Frazer, his transfer would have been completed 26 days after he was first assessed Several witness said this was one of the quickest transfers they had experienced. xvi. When a code blue or code red is called at HMP Guys Marsh, evidence was given that the control room do not automatically call an ambulance and before doing so, ask questions such as is the patient conscious and breathing. Annex A of Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 03\/2013 requires an ambulance to be called automatically as a mandatory contingency response upon a code blue or red being called, and the directs staff to await updates from the scene. This PSI is not currently being followed at HMP Guys Marsh. xvii. Frazer did not have any contact with his family whilst at HMP Guys Marsh and when his mother was told of his death, she thought it was a mistake as she thought he was still at HMP Winchester. She had been writing to Frazer at HMP Winchester through the email a prisoner service. There was no evidence her correspondence had reached Frazer. Email a prisoner is based on the person in the community who wants to contact the prisoner, entering the prisoner\u2019s location in the prison estate, rather than their unique prison number. If the location is wrong or the prisoner has been moved, the prisoner will not receive the contact. xviii. Frazer told prison staff during his induction at HMP Guys Marsh and the ACCT assessment that he was in contact with his family and he used his parents for support. Familial contact can be a key protective factor in the management of a person\u2019s mental health. In the personal information section of Frazer\u2019s NOMIS records, he was recorded as having no next of kin. There is no record the contact details of his next of kin were discussed with him. This evidences missed opportunities to involve Frazer\u2019s family in his care and management prior to his death. xix. Evidence was given that at the time if there was no next of kin 6 recorded for a prisoner at HMP Guys Marsh a monthly report would reveal this and prisoners would be spoken to about this. There is no record Frazer was spoken to about this and it did not appear from the prison there was a clear process as to how next of kin is detailed or checked. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There is inequity within the system of the treatment of a person with mental illness in the prison setting compared to an individual in the community, due to the fact that in the community a person would be placed in a hospital setting on the day they were deemed to require hospital admission, however in prison there are delays in transferring a prisoner in the same situation to hospital. ii. There is a lack of NHS guidance, and joint guidance with HMPPS, on the identification, management, and treatment of someone with self neglect in the prison setting. iii. There is a lack of a national directory detailing the facilities and provision of healthcare at individual prisons across England and Wales, and associated guidance on the transfer of individuals between prison establishments when they are under the care of the healthcare teams and are not placed on medical hold. There is a lack of guidance on consultation with prison doctors where a prisoner is receiving medical care, whether that be for physical or mental health, when there is consideration by the prison to transfer the prisoner who is not placed on medical hold. Further there is a lack of consultation with the healthcare team at the proposed receiving prison to ensure they can provide the appropriate care for the person. iv. There is a lack of national guidance for healthcare teams working in prisons around the handover of healthcare of a prisoner to the receiving prison when they are transferred to another prison. v. There is a lack of national specification in respect of prison healthcare units. vi. There is lack of national guidance for both senior management and operational prison staff in relation to the handover of a prisoner in advance of their transfer, not specific to, but especially those with complex needs, when transferring between prisons. vii. The lack of ACCT quality assurance, or audit, between day 7 of the ACCT and the post closure review. viii. There is lack of automatic flagging of a missed ACCT review at HMP Guys Marsh and this could also be a national problem. 7 ix. Relevant individuals, such as key workers are not being invited to attend ACCT reviews at HMP Guys Marsh in line with ACCT 6 guidance. x. The keyworker scheme is not being delivered in line with national guidance at HMP Guys Marsh. xi. The colour of the cell doors and bedsheets at HMP Guys Marsh, and possibly at other prisons nationally, being very similar can camouflage ligatures. xii. PSI 03\/2013 is not being followed at HMP Guys Marsh as there is no immediate call to the ambulance service when a code blue or red is raised. xiii. There is a lack of process regarding the recording of a prisoner\u2019s next of kin and involvement of them at HMP Guys Marsh. xiv. The email a prisoner system is dependant on the person wanting to contact the prisoner knowing their location, so if the prisoner is transferred to another prison and the person contacting them is not aware, contact which can be a protective factor particularly in a prisoner\u2019s mental health care, will not be facilitated.",["inquest","evidence","heard","june","frazer","placed","hmp","lewes","remained","release","october","served","sentence","imprisonment","october","remanded","custody","placed","hmp","winchester","sentenced","term","imprisonment","november","due","released","march","ii","placement","hmp","lewes","frazer","presented","deterioration","mental","health","remained","subject","acct","due","incident","self","harm","also","care","healthcare","team","point","release","october","iii","following","arrival","hmp","winchester","residential","healthcare","unit","referrals","made","mental","health","team","frazer","assessed","psychiatrist","december","felt","suffering","enduring","psychotic","illness","required","review","iv","january","frazer","transferred","hmp","guys","marsh","hmp","guys","marsh","healthcare","unit","hour","prison","healthcare","provision","healthcare","team","operating","hours","daily","email","sent","healthcare","team","hmp","winchester","healthcare","team","hmp","guys","marsh","frazer","name","person","interest","handover","took","place","healthcare","teams","prison","staff","teams","vi","following","frazer","transfer","head","healthcare","hmp","guys","marsh","raised","inappropriate","transfer","investigation","clinical","opinion","transferred","hmp","guys","marsh","prior","frazer","transfer","discussion","healthcare","teams","hmp","winchester","guys","marsh","prison","service","consider","suitability","frazer","transfer","view","fact","process","assessed","confirmed","diagnosis","made","relating","mental","health","vii","associate","medical","director","practice","plus","group","ppg","provided","healthcare","hmp","lewes","hmp","guys","marsh","frazer","establishments","confirmed","national","directory","explains","healthcare","facilities","available","prison","ppg","created","one","internally","prisons","provide","healthcare","explained","would","assist","making","decisions","around","suitability","location","within","prison","estate","prisoners","given","needs","national","directory","across","prisons","would","greatly","assist","ppg","different","healthcare","providers","across","prisons","gave","example","would","know","many","disability","access","beds","cells","prisons","ppg","provide","healthcare","also","explained","national","specification","relation","healthcare","units","viii","frazer","person","complex","needs","mental","health","deteriorated","hmp","guys","marsh","would","spend","time","cell","generally","engage","staff","acct","reviews","records","missed","secreted","medication","held","delusionary","beliefs","toilet","flushed","watched","television","family","would","come","harm","cell","extremely","poor","state","littered","rubbish","unflushed","toilet","bucket","used","urinate","defecate","bucket","found","full","cell","time","death","acknowledged","staff","time","self","neglecting","referred","safety","intervention","meeting","sim","process","february","head","healthcare","gave","evidence","adequate","plan","prison","healthcare","teams","manage","frazer","self","neglect","ix","national","guidance","manage","self","neglect","prison","hmpps","currently","finalising","social","care","learning","brief","managing","self","neglect","expected","issued","later","year","however","nhs","guidance","issue","joint","guidance","hmpps","nhs","manage","self","neglect","prison","setting","frazer","mental","health","deteriorated","extent","following","assessment","february","deemed","require","transfer","hospital","section","mental","health","act","second","doctor","assessment","carried","following","day","february","application","sent","ravenswood","house","hospital","secure","unit","within","southern","health","nhs","foundation","trust","february","frazer","visited","community","psychiatrist","february","confirmed","required","transfer","hospital","full","assessment","treatment","warrant","obtained","ministry","justice","transfer","march","bed","offered","hmp","guys","marsh","hospital","march","admission","march","however","prison","could","facilitate","escort","day","hospital","could","facilitate","safe","admission","friday","march","weekend","transfer","arranged","monday","march","frazer","told","march","would","transferred","hospital","however","evidence","indicated","told","approximately","march","frazer","found","deceased","cell","suspended","ligature","xi","ligature","made","ripped","bedsheet","attached","top","corner","cell","door","bedsheet","colour","door","seen","prior","death","therefore","camouflaged","refer","attached","photograph","cell","door","shows","ligature","place","colour","cell","doors","prison","directed","governor","prison","national","directive","however","bedsheets","issued","nationally","across","prison","estate","similarity","colour","could","national","issue","apply","prisons","xii","acct","opened","relation","frazer","january","remained","open","death","january","march","case","reviews","acct","records","incomplete","inadequate","last","case","review","took

appropriateness of the police response to the report of as a missing person on 29 April was considered by the IOPC. In evidence at the inquest, I heard from their -who concluded that there had been an opportunity to raise the risk to high at an earlier stage. He did note, however, that the matter had ostensibly been handled with as a high-risk response for some time prior to its re-categorisation at that level. I was not able to conclude that the delay in raising the level of risk to high had been causative of the death as it was not known at what time had, in fact, hanged himself. It had to be noted that there was a period of approximately eight hours before he was first reported to police as a missing person. It was accepted in evidence that the decision as to the appropriate level of risk was essentially a \"judgement call\" on the part of the individual officer. It was further accepted that there would be occasions when these judgements would be very finely balanced. It was not felt that there had been any failure to follow practice or protocol at a local level. It was noted, however, that it would be sensible to share the salient facts with you in order that there could be a proper review of the guidance contained within the relevant College of Policing APP upon which the police officers relied.

On the 14th November 2017 (page 12 of 33) it was agreed with to add her to her GP surgery waiting list for counselling in line with her treatment preference. remained on the IAPT waiting list for counselling at the time of her death. b) The evidence at the inquest was that a 3 month time interval would be optimal but in case, in relation to this GP surgery, 10 months would be the norm. Such a delay is sub-optimal and could have an adverse effect on a 2 patient waiting for counselling to commence. 2. Risk assessment and progress notes. a) The electronic records were hard for a lay person to follow or understand particularly when said to have been updated or validated with the potential for original entries to have been overwritten (as opposed to amended or deleted). If the user of the system understands it then that does not make it unfit for purpose but it was not clear how a user would readily see what had originally been written. b) This is distinct from progress notes and\/or risk assessments being accurately recorded. It was not clear when and how often risk assessments should be updated and how and when they would be read in conjunction with the progress notes. Were risk assessments intended to be summaries if a user did not have time to read all the progress notes? What function were they intended to serve?

gatekeeping assessment included a mental health state examination, where it was the clinical opinion of the new mental health practitioner from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team, that Ms Morris required an inpatient hospital admission to a mental health ward as there was an immediate risk to her safety as she was found to be a high risk of walking in front of a car. Whilst Ms Morris agreed to an informal admission, this was not possible at the time of assessment as there were no beds available nationally within the NHS or privately. As an inpatient admission was not possible, the option was to attend the Accident and  Emergency Department or to remain in the community whilst waiting for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris had been informed that if she attended the Accident and Emergency Department, there could be a wait of three days for an inpatient mental health bed to become available. Ms Morris did not wish to wait in the Accident and Emergency Department for three days. A safety plan was agreed that Ms Morris would stay overnight with a family member, and would remain under the care of the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who would review the following morning. The family felt that it was pushed for Ms Morris to stay overnight with a family member as there was no alternative to keep her safe. During the course of the inquest, I heard that there is national pressure on hospital trusts as there is a national increase in people waiting for inpatient beds.

was admitted to the mental health unit at approximately 8.30pm. The unit has a staff handover between 9.00pm and 9.30pm. The evidence at inquest was contradictory as to which shift had assumed responsibility for completing admission tasks including risk assessments and care \/ safety plans. It was recognised that admission shortly before or during shift handover can increase risks relating to the quality of information sharing and the allocation of admission tasks such as assessing the level of observations required. The court heard evidence that whilst efforts would be made to avoid admission during staff handover time this was a local practice rather than part of any formal policy. The court further heard evidence that senior staff considered that avoidance of admission at handover times would be difficult to achieve because there were too many different oranisations who might be requesting admission. This appeared to overlook the fact that it is the bed allocation team based at the trust who are the central point of contact. The current operational policy covering admission procedures (Acute Inpatient Operational Policy) does not mention a need for handover time to be protected, avoiding admission during this time.

Lily resided at student accommodation provided by Student Roost. They describe themselves on their website as \u2018a student accommodation provider who puts your wellbeing first. Our aim is to provide the very best experience for you to make the more of student living. Since they ere established in 2017, Student Roost has grown to offer 50+ properties across the UK. Student Roost run a 24\/7 service including a Night Owl Service which is an excellent idea and provides a 24 hour service to help students with everything from loosing their keys, broken taps, but also their wellbeing. During the course of hearing evidence, it is evident that all of Lily\u2019s extreme acts of self-harm took place at her student accommodation. She took at least 3 overdoses and also carried out 2 acts of ligating which she had to be either untied or cut down from. One of those I heard required CPR. I am therefore surprised to learn that no staff (certainly in the 6 properties offering accommodation within Leicester) had first aid training and that it isn\u2019t mandatory, such that no staff are trained by Student Roost in first aid. It transpires therefore that any immediate first aid provided to Lily was provided by those who fortuitously had that training from other organisations before they joined Student Roost. In the context of this case but also wider than that, members of the accommodation staff could potentially be the first people at the scene of a situation requiring first aid and then emergency services; where death may occur the fact therefore that they receive no training concerns me. (2) I have spent a lot of time in this inquest investigating the information which was known about Lily, about her mental health and who had access to what information in the context of assessing her risk. In September of 2023, Miss Evans, Assistant Coroner sitting within the Rutland and North Leicestershire jurisdiction heard an inquest concerning a student at Loughborough University. Similar to Lily\u2019s case he was under the care of a private psychiatrist elsewhere in the country where he had lived prior to attending university. As a result of concerns in that case (his death occurring 1 year before Lily\u2019) around lack of contact by the Crisis Team at the time of assessment or otherwise with the private psychiatrist, the Coroner wrote to the Leicestershire Partnership Trust to share her concerns. The Trust referenced the Crisis Team Standard Operating procedure in the inquest in September 2023, the Coroner was concerned about the level of awareness that staff members had of any expectation required of them set out within that procedure to seek information from other agencies. I now have sight of the Cris Team Standard Operating Procedure. It sets out the keyworker responsibilities. The section is drafted presupposing that patients are receiving care and treatment from the Crisis Team and only at that point does the responsibility for seeking relevant information from other agencies kick in. Furthermore the emphasis upon that requirement is limited to one line which reads \u2018responsibility for referrals and liaising with other agencies involved\u2019. That is anything but clear as to any expectation upon staff to ensure they have at their disposal all of the relevant risk information at the time of making that assessment; nor does it in my view set out any expectation upon staff to proactively  make contact with treating clinicians in the private sector to gain information. It would not capture situations such as Lily\u2019s, who was discharged from the Crisis Team after an 1 hour assessment and therefore was not under their care and treatment, I having found a failure

witnesses indicated that the Risk proactive management and monitoring. last such narrative in a previously completed assessment. Further, the evidence was that rather than be used for a detailed assessment per the indicators set out in the tool at the time of each relevant event, it was reviewed to instead access any past assessment in order (only) to establish quickly a benchmark against which the gauge a patient\u2019s current presentation when considering their risks. The detailed indicators informing the risk assessment were not updated. Although it was submitted that patient risk was nonetheless assessed and recorded in the EPJS, and acknowledged that benchmarking\/comparison is useful, I am concerned that: (1) if the risk indicators set out in the tool are not systematically reviewed or reconsidered, then the assessment of risk that follows will then be based on incomplete, and therefore misleading, information; and (2) absent the above, and dating of revisions within a compound document, it is not clear on what indicators any assessment is in fact based (3) to the extent the risk assessment is used as a benchmarking tool, the impression given to the most recent viewer is then likely to be incomplete and misleading; (4) the apparent current use of the tool to establish a point of benchmarking\/comparison is in any event lost where the compound narrative assessments are not clearly dated and signposted ; (5) if the detailed patient assessment is instead placed as a new entry in the general chronological notes, the usefulness of the tool as a clear, well signposted, dated assessment and documentation of the patients of risk(s), is lost, requiring a reviewer to instead review the general chronological log of

Shortage of staff. This has been a longstanding concern in Cornwall. I am aware there have been initiatives undertaken nationally and internationally and yet the problem remains. It seems this is not an issue that can be resolved by the local ICB and so this concern is directed to the Secretary of State for her attention and formal response. The following two issues require a response from the ICB and not the Secretary of State. (2) As noted above, the inquest was informed that where patients with complex PTSD\/EUPD present in crisis, national and local practice is not to detain in a secure hospital. The inquest also heard that in other areas of the country there is a therapeutic alternative of admission to a day hospital (ie not detained, but somewhere to permit de-escalation) or to a crisis unit\/house\/caf\u00e9. That option is not currently available in Cornwall. (3) The inquest heard that CPFT is commissioned to assess 140 patients annually for autism. The current waiting list for assessment is in the region of two years.

The evidence of Westyorkshire police was that, by the erection of extensive fencing and barriers, measures have been put in place on levels at the carrpark to make it harder for people to fall from those levels, whether deliberately or accidentally. (2) The erection of similar measures on level has been only partial. The point from where Mrs Gawthorpe fell was identified by correlating her location on the ground with the location on level where she had left her phone before her fall. At that location, the parapet wall could still easily be climbed over. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN 1 In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you or organisation have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 28\/06\/2024. I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons; (Mrs Gawthorpe's husband), Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Signed: 0~ ~-----\u00ad

evidence I heard was that the caf\u00e971 service is run as a crisis line for those who are in \u2018lesser crisis\u2019 than those who would call the mental health team crisis line or the crisis resolution home treatment team.. It appears that the cafe71 team is operating in isolation\/ separately to the mental health team, and for those patients who are under the mental health team, they will be unaware of the background and the risk factors for that person. They will take an assessment of that person at face value based on how they are in the call, as they don\u2019t have access to the information held by the mental health team. In addition, there does not appear to be any notification to the mental health team to say that the person has been in contact such that this can be followed up. It is likely that there is notification to the GP but in this case there was no detail provided which could have been passed on, and the timescales for review of correspondence by the GP, who again are operating somewhat in isolation to the mental health team, does not lend itself to the prompt action which may be required by the mental health team.

it could not be safely said when the deceased died, and therefore it could not safely be said that the delay in the ambulance response probably contributed to the death, the concern is that long delays in ambulance response to Category 2 calls create a risk that other deaths will occur in the future. Bearing in mind the national ambulance target response time for a Category 2 call of an average of 18 minutes, with 90% of calls to be responded to within 40 minutes: The average Category 2 response time for the East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust (\u2018EEAST\u2019) in October 2021, the month of this death, was 56 minutes and 2 seconds. The same average time for January 2023, the most recent month for which data was available, was 49 minutes and 3 seconds. Every month since the deceased\u2019s death, EEAST\u2019s Category 2 response time has been above the 90th centile time of 40 minutes. The average EEAST Category 2 response time for a given month in the period from October 2021 to January 2023 is over 1 hour, with a standard deviation of about 20 minutes. Therefore, EEAST\u2019s Category 2 response time remains persistently and consistently far off target. Although I accept on the evidence that action is being taken, on both local and national levels, to prevent future deaths as a result of this issue, the evidence of the results of such actions to date is that these actions have been demonstrably ineffective and have not resulted in a Category 2 average response time for EEAST that is even close to the target time.

I heard evidence at the inquest that Jason did not receive specialist gender dysphoria treatment because he was on the waiting list for the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. There was also evidence that clinicians did not refer Jason for specialist psychiatric support from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in part because the guidance at the time suggested any specialist gender dysphoria treatment should be provided by GIDS. Jason was awaiting a further assessment from CAMHS at the time of his death. 2. On 10 April 2024, i.e. during the course of the inquest, published her report on the independent review of gender identity services for children and young  people (the Cass review). Her recommendations included that: \u201ca smaller number of secondary services within CAMHS and paediatrics should be identified initially to act as Designated Local Specialist Services (DLSS) within each area. This would increase the available workforce through a flexible, multi-site staff group working between the DLSS and the regional centre, with the opportunity to provide targeted training and upskilling.\u201d 3. The Arden and GEM has provided an update on its website entitled the \u201cNational Referral support Service for the NHS Gender Incongruence Service for Children and Young People\u201d. This states: \u201cThe NHS understands it isn\u2019t easy having to wait a long time to be seen by gender services, and young people may need some extra support with their mental wellbeing while they wait. The NHS is offering this support, if needed, through local Children and Young People Mental Health services (CYPMH), also known as Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). People will be contacted to ask if they are happy for their details to be shared with their local CYPMH \/ CAMH service so they can speak to a professional about how they are feeling. This support offer is voluntary and the people\u2019s place on the Children and Young People\u2019s Gender Services waiting list will not change. This service will be contacting parents, children and young people on the waiting list by email or post to ask if they wish to access this support between April and May 2024.\u201d 4. During the inquest, I heard evidence from senior management at the CAMHS run by Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust to the effect that (i) they were unaware that enhanced support was being offered via CAMHS and (ii) due to existing pressures on resources the enhanced support would likely have an impact on the already very long wait times for CAMHS treatment, which in turn would give rise to a risk of patients taking their own lives while waiting for treatment. 5. I am concerned that if urgent clarity is not provided to CAMHS teams, patients and parents on the appropriate national referral mechanisms for gender services, and the resources available for those

Assessments I heard evidence to confirm that Ash was subject to a Ligature Risk Ba which was put into place after Ash ligatured in December 2020, at that time the Risk was deemed to be a \u201cmedium\u201d risk. The Ligature Risk Assessment was reassessed in April 2021 at which time the risk level was lowered to \u201clow\u201d. I heard evidence to confirm that at some point between the April 2021 review and Ash\u2019s death a decision to remove Ash\u2019s personal Ligature Risk Assessment was made. United Children\u2019s Services were unable to tell me the date on which the decision to remove Ash\u2019s Ligature Risk Assessment was made because there is no documentation relating to the date on which that decision was made or the reasons why that decision was made. This lack of documentation is a grave concern. Ash died on 7 August 2021 from 1a) Hanging (suspension placing a ligature around the neck) there was no personal Ligature Risk Assessment in place at the time of death. Documentation and communication I heard evidence to confirm there was no documentation created by United Children\u2019s Services to detail the date on which Ash\u2019s Ligature Risk Assessment was deemed to be no longer required or to explain the rationale behind the making of that decision. There is no documentation to explain or justify the deviation from Ash\u2019s care plan on the morning that Ash died.  Further, the Court heard evidence to confirm that there was little or no communication of Ash\u2019s historic Child Sexual Exploitation risk between the two United Children\u2019s Services care homes when Ash moved from The Oaks to The Laurels in July 2020. Lack of documentation and poor communication is a concern. Waking Night Cover I heard evidence to confirm that Ash had consumed alcohol on the evening of 5 August 2021. Due to appropriate concerns about the consumption of alcohol when on anti-psychotic medication staff at the residential care home implemented an \u201cad hoc\u201d waking night process, this means that a member of staff remained outside Ash\u2019s bedroom door and awake all night. During the waking night period Ash went into the lavatory and made what are described as \u201csuperficial\u201d cuts to her neck, a blade was later removed from Ash. The next day, on 6 August 2021, staff described Ash as having a good day. Ash went to bed as normal at around 2150hrs. There was no ad hoc waking night cover implemented. Ash was not checked on from the time Ash went to bed at 2150hrs until 0900hrs on the 7 August 2021, a period of 11 hours. During those 11 hours Ash ended their life. Ash was found hanging at 9am on 7 August 2021. The decision to implement ad hoc waking night cover is not a decision which is governed by policy at United Children\u2019s Services. I heard evidence to confirm that the decision is based upon the gut instinct of the staff on duty at the time. The fact there is no policy to specifically deal with ad hoc waking nights means the decision making around the same will not be consistent and therefore the level of care provided to the children in the care of United Children\u2019s Services is heavily dependent on which staff member is on duty at the time that the care is needed. Further, there is no step down process to wean children off ad hoc waking night cover. In Ash\u2019s case Ash went from having a staff member outside her door throughout the night from 5 to 6 August 2021 to having a period of 11 hours where Ash was entirely unsupervised throughout the night from 6 to 7 August 2021. It was during those 11 unsupervised hours that Ash ended their life. Compliance with care and support plans Ash had a \u201csupport plan\u201d and I was told in evidence that support plans contain \u201ccrucial\u201d information relating to residents. Ash\u2019s support plan stipulated that Ash was to be checked on every morning at 7am. Ash was not checked upon at 7am on the morning of her death, this is a breach of Ash\u2019s support plan. There was nothing documented in any of the records disclosed to the Court to explain why the support plan was deviated from on this occasion. I was told by care home workers that they would not expect to check on a teenager at 7am at the weekend in a normal family home. The residential care home where Ash was living was not a normal family home but a therapeutic home for children with complex needs. The evidence from the Operations Manager at United Children\u2019s Services who run the home was that Ash should have been checked on at 7am. Ash\u2019s support plan was incorrectly deviated from without any documentation, explanation or justification as to why. This should not have happened. Staff training The Court heard evidence from one member of staff who worked at a United Children\u2019s Services  care home for a period of 4.5 months and did not know what Child Sexual Exploitation was. The Court heard evidence to confirm that new staff members have 6 months to complete all of their training meaning it is possible to have staff members working with children with complex needs and vulnerabilities who do not have a full understanding of the spectrum of their needs due to not having completed all of their training yet. United Children\u2019s Services Investigation policy and process I heard evidence to confirm that United Children\u2019s Services do have an investigations policy, albeit that document was not disclosed to the Court despite a request for confirmation as to whether any internal investigation of any kind was undertaken and confirmation of what investigatory processes were available to United Children\u2019s Services to use after Ash\u2019s death. I heard conflicting evidence at the inquest in relation to whether an investigation was undertaken by United Children\u2019s Services after Ash\u2019s death. I was told (1) there was no internal investigation but they did feed into the Local Authority\u2019s Safeguarding Investigation and (2) there was an investigation undertaken by United Children\u2019s Services but the outcome of the investigation was not documented. I heard evidence from the Operations Manager at United Children\u2019s Services to confirm that the investigation which took place after Ash\u2019s death but which was not formally documented was discussed at the United Children\u2019s Service\u2019s Board Meeting around 6 or 7 months post death. Ash died in August 2021, the Board Meeting will therefore have taken place in or around February or March 2022. I heard evidence to confirm that the required changes to the United Children\u2019s Services investigation policy and process were discussed at the Board Meeting but that at the time of the inquest, 2 years and 1 month after the Board Meeting and 2 years and 8 months after Ash\u2019s death, those changes had \u201cnot yet\u201d been made. I asked why changes had not been made and was told that United Children\u2019s Services wanted to get the inquest process \u201cout of the way\u201d before making any changes. I have grave concerns about the fact that United Children\u2019s Services have been running homes in the knowledge that they have an inadequate investigation process in place for over two years. Significant learning came to light at the inquest which United Children\u2019s Services were not aware of before the inquest. It was accepted by United Children\u2019s Services that their investigation policy and process was not fit for purpose because it failed to identify all of the learning arising from Ash\u2019s death. If an investigation was undertaken by United Children\u2019s Services after Ash\u2019s death it: (1) Was not documented; (2) Failed to identify all of the learning uncovered at the inquest; (3) Failed to trigger any changes at United Children\u2019s Services. The investigation process in place at United Children\u2019s Services is therefore not fit for purpose. Policies and processes at United Children\u2019s Services in general I have concerns about policies and processes in place at United Children\u2019s Services, including the investigations policy, the policies governing risk assessments, in particular the ligature risk assessment, and the ad hoc waking nights process. I heard evidence at the inquest about United Children\u2019s Service\u2019s plan to make, what appear on the face of it, to be broad and wide-reaching changes to their policies and processes.  However, at the time of writing this report those changes have not been discussed, finalised, implemented or embedded. The children in the care of the United Children\u2019s Services will, in my opinion, remain at risk until such time as appropriate and effective action is taken and the necessary changes are

The Governor of the  prison in her evidence to me, spoke about indeterminate sentences and said \"In my personal view they are indefensible\". She went on to say \"We find that some of the most challenging behaviours are from this group of men who feel trapped.\" The governor also commented that if I were to submit a Regulation 28 report to the Minister for Prisons; \"most Prison Governors would welcome that intervention.\" On the 9th September 2005 Mr Rider received an Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence with a tariff of 23 months; at the time of his death he had served seventeen and half years and had given up all hope of release.

The evidence I heard at inquest indicated the level of police response should have been classed as a Grade 2 Vulnerable to ensure a more timely response. (2) No oversight of the incident took place for over 9 hours and at that a comment was made that there were no resources able to attend, but no other options\/alternatives were pursued. (3) The family of Stevyn Carr contacted police some 15 hours after the first call to the police and after this a further 1 hour and 23 minutes elapsed before police went to his address and found him. (4) I heard evidence at inquest that a number of incidents were \u2018delayed\u2019 for a significant period for lack of police resources and this position was common place at that time. (5) I have asked for evidence to satisfy me that the position in terms of police attendance has improved both within the area Stevyn Carr died, but across the Northumbria Police force area. The evidence I have received is difficult to interpret and not comprehensive. I am concerned whether the changes to the management of incidents and\/or training in relation to the grading of incidents by Northumbria Police has improved since Stevyn Carr\u2019s death, to the

case identified that there is a lack of clear understanding of the risk or accountability between the agencies when a young person transitions from CAMBS services at the age of 18 to adult services. The expert who provided evidence in this case said that this was a well-recognized problem and whilst services across the country had tried to address this, there was a lack of national guidance and provision. In this particular case Axel was particularly vulnerable. He was born Yasmin Price but identified as a male from a young age. He had struggled emotionally during his teens and had indulged with alcohol and drugs. He had been detained on a number of occasions due to his mental health. At the age of 18 he transitioned to adult services but there was a lack of a recognised pathway for him. In the lead up to his death he had been discharged from a mental health provision following his arrest for criminal offences. He was then discharged from the hospital and subsequently the Police station to temporary accommodation. There was little shared understanding between agencies of how Axel should best be supported and therefore he appeared to fall between the services. Substantial changes have been made locally by Sussex Partnership Foundation NHS Trust around the transition of those from CAMBS to Adult health services but looking at other Prevention of Future Death Reports this is not just a local issue. There is a lack of national guidance and support in relation to the multi-agency approach that is needed to support those young people transitioning to adult health and social care services.

and all subsequent assessments seriously fail to recognise that Paul\u2019s prolonged choice not to eat or drink were in fact indications of \u2018action\u2019 to end his own life and therefore he should have been considered as a suicide risk.\u201d Action is needed to prevent future failure to recognise (a) when the prolonged choice of a patient detained under the Mental Health Act not to eat or drink should be regarded as an action to end their own life; and (b) when such a patient\u2019s prolonged choice not to eat or drink should be recognised as elevating that patient\u2019s suicide risk (including of suicide by means other than malnourishment). At the conclusion of the Inquest, after the Jury had returned the completed Record of Inquest, I asked the Norfolk & Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (\u2018NSFT\u2019) to assist me with written information to inform me of what action is being taken to prevent future deaths related to the \u201cserious failures\u201d in risk assessment as to suicide risk identified by the Jury within their answer to how Mr Templeton died. I am grateful for the letter addressed to me, dated 29th February 2024, from the Deputy Chief Executive & Chief People Officer of NSFT. However, the contents of this letter did not allay my concern in this regard. The letter reiterated factual points that were substantially placed before the Jury in evidence. The letter then set out what appears in my view to be the central point that NSFT wished to make: \u201cAt no point prior to or during Mr Templeton\u2019s admission, did he present as a risk of self- harm or suicide other than through food or fluid restriction and on that basis there was no evidence to include previous history, recorded thoughts, ideation or plans to identify a risk of ligature. To implement a more restrictive environment upon Mr Templeton without evidence to do so would amount to a blanket restriction in breach of Regulations 13 and 17 of the Health and Social Care Act\u2026\u201d This response does not grasp, engage with, or show reflection in light of the Jury\u2019s finding. It therefore does not allay my concern that circumstances creating a risk of further deaths will occur, or will continue to exist, in the future. The Jury\u2019s finding was precisely that Mr Templeton did present as a risk of self-harm or suicide other than through food or fluid restriction \u2013 and that NSFT failed to recognise this risk as it was expressed by way of Mr Templeton choosing not to eat or drink. Although NSFT\u2019s letter argues that implementing a more restrictive environment without evidence to do so would amount to an impermissible blanket restriction, the Jury\u2019s finding was precisely that there was evidence (namely the prolonged choice not to eat and drink) that should have been recognised as being action taken to end his own life and therefore implying an elevated suicide risk. NSFT\u2019s letter goes on to draw my attention to three actions for improvement that are underway or in process. Firstly, \u201cThe inpatient clinical team to improve the quality and consistency of their psychological, food and fluid recording and discussions of the same within MDT recording.\u201d While improved discussions regarding food and fluid recording might conceivably trigger recognition of when a refusal to eat or drink indicates suicidal ideation and action, merely recording and discussing food and fluid intake does not necessarily entail recognising when refusal to eat or drink reflects greater suicide risk. This action on its own does not appear to raise awareness among those conducting suicide risk assessments that a prolonged refusal to eat or drink may reflect an elevated suicide risk, as recognised by the Jury. It may be that review is required on the learning, training, and \/ or guidance given to assist those undertaking suicide risk assessments in relation to how they should interpret a prolonged refusal to eat or drink and the risk of suicide arising from such action.  Of course, it is not for the Coroner to recommend what action is required or to make specific remedial recommendations. Secondly, \u201cThe Community and Crisis team were identified as requiring improvement by ensuring routine weighing of patients to provide baseline and discussing and sharing the same\u2026\u201d. Thirdly, \u201cThe Crisis team was identified as requiring improvement in respect of ensuring physical health is monitored and considered within assessments\u2026\u201d Neither of these actions

The adequacy of Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust\u2019s (NSFT) Integrated Delivery Team (IDT) decision making concerning the discharge of a patient from mental health services in circumstances where a failed engagement has occurred. 2. The adequacy of NSFT\u2019s Crisis Rehabilitation.tion Home Treatment Team (CRHTT) response to an urgent referral, in particular; risk assessment, safety planning and decision making concerning the downgrading of referrals. 3. Adequacy of the NHS England Patient Safety Incident Response Framework (PSIRF) to address serious incidents concerning patients and the implementation of this framework by NSFT. I received evidence from NSFT concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken to address my concerns. This evidence included the following: a. Care Group communication has improved across the Trust. b. Skills Training on Risk Management (STORM), covering suicide and self-harm awareness training, was being implemented across the Trust. c. Staff were being engaged concerning waiting lists and expectation management and how to present these to patients in a positive manner. d. The downgrade policy concerning crisis line referrals had been changed in 2023 to make the circumstances concerning a downgrade clearer and what was expected of nursing staff involved in these decisions.  This evidence has not allayed my concerns. I remain concerned that many of the measures outlined by NSFT are prospective and have not been introduced. I note: i. STORM training continues to be rolled out, although the evidence from a number of witnesses questioned the effectiveness of the rollout in reaching all staff. ii. Whilst the downgrade policy concerning urgent referrals has been tightened up, key parts of the process, such as the handover document between shifts, is still to be introduced. iii. The Trust SOP addressing the downgrading of urgent referrals, which I was told was revised in 2023, has not been provided to the Court and has not been implemented by the Trust. iv. Changes to the way the Trust investigates incidents such as Ellie\u2019s, including the use of a screening tool to determine how the PSIRF process is implemented, the requirement to retain recordings of calls and which statements are to be taken to inform serious patient incident investigations, are still to be introduced by the Trust. v. The failure by NSFT to preserve important evidence, in the form of recordings of calls between Ellie and the NSFT crisis call handler, at a time when it was on notice that this evidence would be

1. Inadequate review and incident investigation following a death Following Mr Lyalushko\u2019s death, Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust completed an SI Review by way of case note review. Following evidence which considered the content of that review, the Trust stated that the review was \u2018insufficient in its current form and the scope should be broadened to include the concerns raised (during the inquest hearing).\u2019 The Trust said its Patient Safety Investigation Lead would undertake a new SI Review by 26 April 2024 (6 weeks). I identified a number of deficiencies with the initial SI Review which had been undertaken in respect of Mr Lyalushko: it did not identify that a request from Mr Lyalushko\u2019s GP in November 2022 for involvement of its service with Mr Lyalushko had not been actioned; it incorrectly identified areas where improvements were required as areas of good practice; and it did not involve any level of consultation with Mr Lyalushko\u2019s family to consider whether there were any areas of concern they had which might direct elements of the review. If there is insufficient review and learning from a death that, in my judgment, adds to the likelihood of future deaths occurring in similar circumstances.

When Mrs Cobain cancelled her appointment scheduled for Monday 6 September 2021 by email on Saturday 4 September 2021, the system nevertheless generated an automatic questionnaire which is normally is sent 24 hours prior to a scheduled assessment appointment. The system had not recognised that Mrs Cobain had cancelled her appointment. appointment. She completed the questionnaire. 2. Mrs Cobain\u2019s responses to the questionnaire contained what were accepted to be concerning responses. 3. Due to the cancellation the questionnaire was not reviewed by a clinician until after Mrs Cobain\u2019s sad death. 4. Changes have been made to the protocols around cancellation, and language has been added to the assessment template. 5.

The inquest was told that Tobias had sought and had been referred for mental health support however due to the high demand and long waiting lists 2 he was still on a waiting list at the time of his death. The evidence before the inquest was that long delays were still an issue and were not restricted to Tameside but were part of a national picture of delays and long waiting lists for those seeking help with their mental health. 2. The inquest also heard evidence of the impact of homelessness and consequential vulnerability on a young person like Tobias and that the demands on Local Authorities meant that even where vulnerability was recognised there were not resources to offer sustained support and stable housing solutions. The evidence was that as a consequence young vulnerable people had to rely on homeless shelters where they were exposed to additional negative influences and as in Tobias\u2019s case abuse due to their sexuality. 3. Evidence was also heard that a person who has to rely on a homeless shelter can then become uncontactable to public service providers as they have no address for contact which means they then have even less chance of accessing support. 4. The inquest was told that young adults who are homeless are often sexually exploited and that those who identify as LGBTQIA can be particularly vulnerable and that the underlying vulnerability and risk was not always appreciated by those dealing with young homeless people and that it could be mistaken by agencies as a lifestyle choice rather than what it actually was, i.e., exploitation by an older adult. 5. The evidence before the inquest was that where multiple agencies were involved it was fundamental that one agency\/person took overall ownership\/responsibility to ensure a coordinated and effective

the Inquest I heard evidence that prior to his death on 6th September 2022, Jason Brown received from the pharmacy his prescribed medication in a form of a full pack of tablets of Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (clopixol). The pharmacy confirmed in evidence that this had been dispensed as a full pack in accordance with its special container status. Jason was prescribed his medication in weekly doses due to a history which included previous attempts to take an overdose of his medication. Jason received this full pack of tablets only 17 days before taking an overdose of this medication on 6th September 2022. The pharmacy also confirmed that another patient at the practice received the same medication in a 7-day monitored dosage system (MDS) but could not confirm whether the remaining pack was then disposed of for that patient. I am concerned that, due to a special container status, a box of tablets of Zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride (clopixol) must be dispensed in its own special container as a full pack of tablets (original pack dispensing) and that this can endanger the safety of a patient with a history of suicidal risk and previous overdose attempts.

an informal Mental Health bed been available on the 6th June 2023, and Nicola had been admitted as both she and her psychiatrist had wished, her death would not have occurred. I am therefore concerned in relation to the overall bed mind capacity for those patients like Nicola seeking informal inpatient admission. Nicola\u2019s case is not an isolated one. Evidence was heard from the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust, that on the day of the inquest itself (23rd February 2024), the availability of bed provision for informal Mental Health patients had failed to improve at all. The court heard that on the 23rd February 2024, the Operational Pressure Escalation Level was at its highest level (Four Black) and that at time of Nicola\u2019s inquest, in Suffolk alone, there were 20 patients on a list waiting for an informal inpatient Mental Health bed. The court heard, that just as on the 6th June 2023, there were no other available informal Mental Health beds anywhere else in the country. The facts of Nicola\u2019s case mirror those of another tragic Suffolk case, for which I produced a Prevention of Future Death Report in October 2020. I am therefore concerned, that any measures that may have been taken in the intervening period since October 2020, have neither adequately, or effectively, addressed this clear and continuing local

the inquest it came to light that John was prescribed medications for depression and epilepsy whilst incarcerated. His compliance with medications was found to be sporadic and as a result he failed to collect a number of prescriptions to enable continuity of his medication. Some of the reasons around this were anxiety in attending to collect his medications and also periods of self-isolation. Whilst Healthcare at the prison were aware of some of the periods of non-compliance and in fact a GP referral and action was taken to enable John to have weekly in-possession medication to support his compliance, other periods were not flagged or identified and it became clear that monitoring those prisoners who are not medication compliant, particularly if receiving weekly or monthly medication was challenging due to the SystmOne electronic patient system not being able to flag a warning for non-compliant prisoners for early identification and referral. John subsequently suffered a decline in his mental health and whilst the lack of medication compliance was not deemed to cause or contribute to his death, the importance of consistent medication for medical conditions and early identification of prisoners who do not comply was an issue which was raised and explored within the inquest. The action taken by the prison after John's suicide was to put a cross check system in place by which pharmacy technicians cross reference the medication by way of a weekly stock check to identify the prisoners who have not collected medications or had the same dispensed, so that referrals can be made to the Healthcare team and or GP to task. Such a system is less than ideal as it is both resource heavy, carries real risks of not being accurate and in the Coroners view, for prisoners in possession of medication, there is likely to be a much longer period before non-compliance is identified which carries real risks of fatalities. The inquest touched upon the SystmOne electronic record used across the Prison estates by Healthcare. From the evidence it appears that the system has a facility to flag concerns and tasks to action and in fact, certain flags are generated automatically to alert healthcare staff to live issues around a prisoner, however, something as simple and the system generating a warning flag to identify when medication is not dispensed or collected was neither possible nor available on the current operating system. An automated flag alert via the system upon the failure to dispense or collect medication by a prisoner would be a far more efficient and effective way in which prisoners failing to comply with

The London Borough of Camden Council is the Freeholder of Tavistock Chambers. I learned in evidence from local witnesses and officers from the Metropolitan Police Service that Miss Senior\u2019s death, as a result of using to complete suicide, was the second of its type within approximately 18-months. evidence from a resident of one of the flats in Tavistock Chambers set out that the only access to the residential part of the building is through a door , which has \u201ca secure key fob entry system\u201d. However, the evidence was that \u201cWe have constant issues with this front entrance either not locking or not opening with the key, there is also a latch to hook the door open at times\u201d. The witness confirmed that the front entrance was hooked open at the material time; this was confirmed by photographic evidence provided by the Metropolitan Police Service. There was also evidence that approximately a year prior to the events of 24 September 2023, \u201cCamden Council locked the only access .\u201d The witness had assumed that it remained bolted and locked. However, other evidence, including photographic evidence from the Metropolitan Police Service, showed that although there was a clear \u2018no entry\u2019 sign , it was not locked shut. A statement from a Detective Sergeant revealed, \u201cA yellow padlock was locked onto the sliding bolt, to give an illusion it was locked, however the clasp had not been held down into the lock, so it could have been opened by any person.\u201d It was also established in evidence that Miss Senior did know any of the residents of Tavistock Chambers or in the vicinity generally. As such, it appeared that her entry to the building was entirely opportunistic. However, that aside, the evidence suggested that both of the safety systems installed to prevent unauthorised access to the building were not working effectively at that time. The concern is that it appears that the safety systems in place to stop unauthorised access in particular, were not operating\/being used effectively at the material time and the evidence suggests

Passage of information between NHS and private healthcare approachable providers. At a time where pressures on the NHS exist, particularly for mental health services, it is of concern that measures which could alleviate this pressure (where someone sources private care) do not exist. There is little or no policy, guidance or other effective arrangements to share important clinical information about patients between private and public healthcare sectors. b. The handling of the incident involving Mrs. CHRISMAS in Hampshire Constabulary\u2019s Force Control Room which resulted in a hour delay in determining that an important communication (being a request for assistance) had not been received by a neighbouring force. This raises concerns as to the effectiveness in the supervision of operators handling the calls and the presence of redundancies or safeguards to detect such circumstances sooner to avoid repetition. I received further evidence orally and in writing from the Interested Persons\u2019 subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns. This evidence included responses from Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP), The Priory Hospital, concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the concerns identified during the course of the Inquest with respect to sub-paragraph a. (above). I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of those Interested Persons. In addition, I received evidence from Hampshire Constabulary concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the concerns identified during the course of the Inquest as outlined at sub-paragraph b. (above). These measures included: a. Revision of training provided and the introduction of additional training for supervisors and control room staff. b. Implementation of National Policy concerning Missing Persons, including documentation to assist in control room responses to similar circumstances. c. Revision of the recording of risk assessment measurements on the computer aided dispatch record (CAD) system. It was further explained to the court that the measures should be seen in the context of wider cultural change management in the supervision and leadership being undertaken by Hampshire Constabulary in the operation of the Control Room. I have taken account of the measures, many of which are of a policy nature, as outlined by Hampshire Constabulary. However, I remain concerned in relation to the matters identified at sub-paragraph b. (above). In addition, I am concerned that, although welcoming the local changes implemented by the Grayshott Surgery Practice, The Priory Roehampton Meghan Irene CHRISMAS (02840-2021) and SABP, there is an absence of a wider national structure within the NHS that facilitates the effective passage of patient information between the private and public healthcare sectors. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 1. The effectiveness in the supervision of operators handling calls in the Hampshire Police Force Control Room to detect circumstances such as those which involved Mrs. CHRISMAS sooner and to avoid repetition. Evidence of the change required in this respect, was not provided to the court beyond limited training measures; either in the form of a plan to bring such change about, or evidence that such change has otherwise occurred. 2. The passage of information between NHS and private healthcare providers is hindered due to the absence of an adequate structure to share important clinical information about patients in a timely and

following matters of concern are directed to NHCT for response \u00ad  1. A continuing practice\/culture of minimising the importance of a ward specific risk assessment and care plan I am concerned that, notwithstanding the existence of a clear, appropriate policy and significant commendable actions by the Trust since Daniel\u2019s death to address this issue, there remain clinical and nursing staff who do not fully recognise or accept the importance of completing and utilising the required risk assessment and care plan. This suggests there may be a persisting training or cultural issue. The inquest heard evidence that there was (and remains) a clear and robust policy in place which most staff were aware of. This requires a care plan and risk assessment be initiated upon a patient\u2019s admission, completed within 72 hours of admission and updated as necessary during admission. Further, since Dan\u2019s death, the Trust has gone to considerable and commendable lengths to ensure that care plans and risks assessments are in place in every case and to reinforce the requirements of this guidance within the Nursing team; that team hold primary (but not sole) responsibility for creating and updating the risk assessment and care plan document. I also heard that a recent audit found that all current patients had an appropriate care plan in place. The Ward Manager agreed this is \u201ca basic and fundamental part\u201d of any patient\u2019s care. In spite of all of this, an experienced ward nurse and two psychiatrists (a consultant and a registrar) involved in Dan\u2019s care seemed to minimise the practical importance of the required process and documentation, the latter both suggesting they would not routinely consult it. 2. Inadequate system of allocating a named nurse to patients and recording the same I am concerned that, notwithstanding the existence of a clear, appropriate policy requiring the same, the current system of allocating a named nurse and ensuring patients receive regular and effective 1:1 sessions with them are inadequate. I am also concerned that no record is kept of the named nurse appointed to each patient, thus (as in this case) hindering any investigation where issue around the role and actions of that person arises. The General Manager of Adult Mental Health at the Trust helpfully and frankly acknowledged that the evidence heard at inquest raised questions about the adequacy of the existing system, of which he was not previously aware of. It remains unclear whether Daniel was appointed a Named Nurse who failed to perform that role effectively, or whether there was a failure to appoint such a nurse at all. The General Manager\u2019s view was that under the existing system, it is possible that a named nurse was appointed without their knowledge. While the Ward Manager gave evidence that she would have no confidence Daniel would have known who his named nurse was, even if one was appointed. The inquest heard evidence that named nurse sessions with Daniel during previous admissions had been important opportunities for engagement with staff and had elicited a substantial amount of information pertinent to his risk and treatment. The General Manager assured me that he has already requested an urgent review of the system, but he was unable to provide any further information upon conclusion of the inquest as to what further action, if any, is proposed. 3. Inadequate skills\/knowledge\/training on how to encourage patients to engage I am concerned that clinical, nursing and\/or support staff may not currently have sufficient skills or knowledge in dealing with patients who appear unable or unwilling to engage with staff and\/or treatment. A psychiatrist not involved in Dan\u2019s care gave evidence about the advice he would have given to colleagues on how to seek to assist a patient who, like Dan, was unwilling or unable to engage with staff: first, identify the likely reasons for the patient\u2019s lack of engagement; second, having regard to those reasons, develop plans and strategies to address the specific barriers identified.  I heard little evidence that either of these steps was followed by any of the staff involved in Dan\u2019s care. One barrier was identified (his previous negative experiences on the ward and wish to be transferred to another ward or hospital) but seemingly forgotten after an initial transfer request to the Bed Management team, which was not then followed up. Even with the benefit of hindsight, the doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants involved in Dan\u2019s care seemed unable to offer any insight into the reasons for his difficulties engaging beyond his diagnosis of EUPD or articulate any strategies or techniques that might have helped him overcome them. The following matters of concern are addressed to Secretary of State for Health and Social Care & NHS England 1. I am concerned that confirmed ingestion of during a 999 call does not trigger a category 1 response from the Ambulance Service \/ Dan ingested at around 20:30 on 22 April 2022. His friend informed the 999 call handler that he had done so during a first 999 call at 20:39. That call was correctly graded as requiring a category 2 response, as Dan was both conscious and awake. 14 minutes later, at 20:53, Dan collapsed. His friend\u2019s second 999 call was correctly graded as requiring a category 1 response, as Dan had become unconscious, his breathing agonal. The first ambulance crew arrived at 21:04. Dan went into cardiac arrest at approximately 21:24. Consideration was given by the ambulance crew to scoop and run \u2018 \u2019 to arrange a rendezvous to administer the necessary \u201cdrugs to counter \u201d, but this was no considered longer feasible once Dan had gone into cardiac arrest. evidence expressed deep concern at its easy availability and growing popularity for vulnerable people seeking to end their own lives. The expert toxicological evidence indicated that its acute toxic effects can be rapid (as short as 20 minutes after ingestion, depending on dose) and can quickly become irreversible. The inquest heard evidence from a consultant toxicologist that even in very small quantities (or ) is lethal; it is a potent poison. I understand it is also, tragically, an increasingly common means of suicide. Mental health professionals who gave This suggests that almost any case involving the ingestion of or is likely to be a time critical life-threatening event. Yet it is does not currently fall within that category for the purposes of grading 999 calls, unless the patient is unconscious or not breathing. While there was no evidence that a category 1 response would have prevented Dan\u2019s death, I believe there is a risk that other deaths will occur if ingestion of continues to require a category 2 response. The following matters of concern are addressed to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Chief Executive of OFCOM 1. Continuing accessibility of Dan was using an online suicide forum, Through that forum he was able to engage in discussions with other members and obtain information Notwithstanding the provisions of the Online Safety Act 2023, and apparent attempts to block access to the website, I heard evidence that it remains easily accessible to vulnerable people in the UK. I am concerned that further deaths will occur while this remains the case.

was apparent from the evidence that I heard and read at the inquest that there are serious concerns about the welfare of individuals who remain subject to IPP sentences. For example, the Independent Monitoring Boards (\u2018IMB\u2019) completed a report with key findings entitled \u2018The impact of IPP sentences on prisoners\u2019 wellbeing\u2019 in May 2023. This report was written following the rejection by the government of the recent Justice Select 2 Committee\u2019s recommendation for a re-sentencing exercise to take place for anyone serving an IPP sentence. Whilst the key findings of the IMB report are focused upon the impact upon serving prisoners and the prevention of recall, I was deeply concerned about the evidence I heard in relation to the clear impact that the on-going IPP sentence had had on Mr Price. He had served a three year tariff and at the time of his death he had been released back into the community for nearly ten years Mr Price was anxious about the ever-present potential for recall to prison. Furthermore, he had conveyed in communications to others that he felt that seeking help with his mental health by way of support and medication might count against him when seeking to be successful in discharging the IPP. Whilst Mr Price was engaged with legal support in navigating the review process, the on-going impact of uncertainty of being on an IPP sentence was clearly apparent. As a consequence of undertaking Mr Price\u2019s inquest, the on-going wellbeing of those serving IPP sentences, be that in prison estate or in the community, is a matter of concern to me as a Coroner. The Ministry of Justice is fully apprised of the IPP context and whilst matters have been raised by the IMB I am concerned that specific focus upon the welfare of individuals living in the community

Her Majesty's Senior Coroner for the City of Brighton & Hove Assistant Coroners CATHARINE PALMER LL.B (HONS) GILVA D.J.TISSHAW, BA(LA W)HONS THE CORONER'S OFFICE WOODY ALE, LEWES ROAD BRIGHTON BN23QB Telephone: Brighton (01273) 292046 Fax: Brighton (01273) 292047 involved in face to face meetings with Daniel and help him when he was struggling to get his work in on time and to deal with his academic pressures. In the circumstances I heard that if work was late a penalty would be imposed. This seems ridiculous; why hit a man when he is already down? (2) With regard to communication - this appeared to be deeply flawed amongst the huge number of University departments and units. The health clinic incorporating amongst other things a pharmacy and the counselling service, was excellent offering free access to students. The system failed - Daniel was not in the link between his GP\/counsellor and the student support unit. If this link had been complete I do not believe Daniel would have died when he did. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you AND our or anisation have the ower to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 22nd April 2019. I, the coroner may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise ou must ex lain wh no action is reposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons 1. - Mother 2. - Father 3. - Sussex University Health Centre, For information 4. - Head of Campus and Residential Support 5. - Acting Head of University Counselling Service 6.

That in respect of GMP Call Handler\u2019s being required to call an ambulance to attend the scene, even where it is reported that someone is \u201cdead\u201d there has been no institutional learning following this incident. I asked if there had been any learning, reflection or training since this incident. He said that there hadn\u2019t on this issue. 2. That the training delivered to the first two attending officers did not adequately prepare them for responding to a scene where someone is found hanging in a way which is consistent with their priority to preserve life of a hanging casualty. 3. I heard evidence from Detective Superintendent that both attending officers were part of a cohort of at least 650 officers within GMP (and a larger cohort nationally) who received their 3 initial police training entirely online. I am concerned that both officers\u2019 training on Sudden Death (and the training of others) was delivered as one of over 15 online modules on a given day and that at the time of the inquest, they had not received any classroom based or on the job training. I am concerned that they are not the only officers within GMP who have received this level\/method of training input and therefore there is a risk that other officers on duty have inadequate training on this issue. 4. There was evidence given to me by Detective Superintendent that there is an unknown number of GMP officers who are not meeting the expectation of receiving First Aid refresher training within 12 months, which since May 2022 has included training on how to resuscitate a hanging casualty. I am therefore concerned that there remains a cohort of officers who have not had the post May 2022 training that includes how to provide Basic Life Support to this kind of casualty until the arrival

Integrated Health and Care NHS Trust 1. In the inquest, there was evidence that Thomas' family received letters from clinicians from Dudley Integrated Health and Care NHS Trust (DIH) requesting that Thomas made contact with them, which were sent after his death, causing obvious distress to his family. It is not difficult to see that this type of administrative error could lead to significant distress to families who are already vulnerable by virtue of their bereavement, and which could give rise to a risk of death. An RCA carried out by DIH identified that action was to be taken - namely that DIH should work with colleagues at Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCH) to establish and embed the process for notifying of patient deaths. However, this does not appear to be an action that has been identified in BCH's RCA report, and I am concerned by the apparent lack of collaborative working to ensure this process is carried out. 2. Secondly, the evidence on behalf of DIH was that the above action to be taken remains outstanding and has a target completion date that arises after the conclusion of this inquest. I am concerned that if this target is pushed back and\/or is not not met, for whatever reason, there is a risk that future deaths will occur. Upon conclusion of the inquest, I am Functus Officio, with no power to request updates from the Trust to check and ensure that the targets have been met and changes have been made. Whilst I am grateful for the efforts of reassurance provided by representatives of the Trust at the inquest, I am reluctant to dismiss my concerns, particularly where actions remain outstanding, and I have opportunity to take action now to ensure that the risk of future deaths is reduced. Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust 1. The evidence on behalf of Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCH) was that there are numerous recommendations as detailed in its Root Cause Analysis (RCA) report that remain outstanding that have target completion dates that arise after the conclusion of this inquest. These dates have been pushed back once already. I am concerned that if these targets are pushed back further and\/or are not met, for whatever reason, there is a risk that future deaths will occur.

the four months before his imprisonment, Samuel Jordan had been receiving treatment for severe anxiety while registered as a temporary patient with a medical practice in Launceston, Cornwall. Samuel had come to Cornwall from his home in Whitchurch, Hampshire where he was registered with another GP practice. On entering HMP Exeter, the prison Healthcare obtained a summary of Samuel\u2019s GP records from Hampshire via the NHS spine. The records from the Launceston practice were not sent to the prison since the NHS spine only operates to transmit records from the permanent GP practice and not a practice consulted on a temporary basis. As a result, Exeter Prison Healthcare was unaware of Samuel\u2019s mental health issues immediately before coming to Prison and was unaware of a current medication prescription lack of which the jury found contributed to Samuel\u2019s death. The inquest heard that prisoners coming to prison frequently were nomadic and frequently had registered with GP practices on a temporary basis with the records from such practices not coming to the notice of prison healthcare as such records are not 2 accessible through the NHS spine.

The Health Board utilises facilities out of air for acute psychiatric care when there are no available beds in the NHS in North Wales. I was informed that the patients, however, remain the responsibility of the Health Board. During the deceased\u2019s time at Ty Grosvenor it does not appear that any\/all relevant information was shared between the two organisations e.g. deceased\u2019s progress, medication, treatment etc, except for few telephone conversations. b. There was no joined up planning or joint meeting between the Health Board and Ty Grosvenor prior to the deceased\u2019s discharge. c. The prescription and administration record together with a copy of the pre- admission paperwork were only sent to the Health Board two days after the deceased was discharged. d. The discharge summary was emailed to the Health Board three days after discharge, but this was either not received by the Health Board or received and not acted upon. In fact, it is the deceased\u2019s wife who had informed the Home Treatment Team that the deceased had been discharged. On knowing this, no one sought to request the discharge summary from Ty Grosvenor, even where there was a change in medication dosage. e. There was no evidence at Inquest of any written agreement or standard operating procedure or similar between the Health Board and private facility as to minimum standard requirements or expectations between both organisations e.g. what documentation should be shared, how it is to be shared, when documentation should be shared, the timeliness of sharing documentation etc. f. It is concerning that such minimum standards are not set out and agreed between the Health Board and this private psychiatric unit in a situation where many patients are likely to be treated there. It is not known whether or not such minimum standards or Agreement exists with other out of area private units. g. In the event that patients are to be treated in private units out of the area then there will be a risk of future deaths if such minimum standards regarding sharing of information and communication are not set and agreed between the Health Board and private facility.

Trust\u2019s Patient Safety Review identified the following concerns: - When Mr Gerasimidis was referred by his GP to the community mental health team, he was screened out, in part, due to challenging staffing issues; - No care coordinator was appointed owing to a shortage of staff; - The Trust had and continues to have vacancies at consultant level; - The family was wrongly advised the Trust was not commissioned to treat OCD; - The family was not informed of a nearest relative\u2019s right under the Mental Health Act to request a case review by an AMHP; - Psychological treatment in the form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Exposure Response Prevention had a waiting list of one year; - In May 2023, when it was felt Mr Gerasimidis required an informal admission into hospital, no beds were available. The difficulties with staff recruitment and bed availability are long term problems in the Cornwall coroner area. The Patient Safety Review suggests Cornwall has fewer beds for its population than other areas.

Matthew was neurodiverse. It was accepted that this condition was not known by the university at the relevant time, as he was diagnosed after his commencement on his course and did not disclose his condition to theist.ppropriate actions and case specific assistance which might otherwise have been availble to and assisted Matthew were neither implemented in response nor accessed by him. Notwithstanding Matthew\u2019s neurodiverity \u2013 which of itself was a barrier to him being able to reach out or to seek help - I am concerned about the level of awareness, understanding and curiosity of accademic staff around the mental health of students, particularly in the post-pandemic climate, where interruptions to their study and dysregulated student life have had a significant impact on their mental health. Whilst it was explained to me that all staff are offered training on mental health management and are provided with guidance on how to support students, I am concerned that aspects of this are not made compulsory for accademic staff. Where a myriad of training options are made availble to staff and often required of them, with very little practical time availble in which to do it, there is a risk that modules and aids with regard to mental health will not be prioritised, followed through or addressed. There is as I understand it no evident monitoring in respect of which staff have viewed or undertaken what training or indeed in respect of who has completed the modules on offer. It remains unclear as to who or how many staff have actually viewed or undertaken the online training around student mental health. Although the process of \u2018raising a concern\u2019 by accademic staff is a means by which such matters can be considered and is a process set up and encouraged through the student hubs, I am concerned that in not ensuring that accademic staff are at least armed with the ability to spot or to know when to make initial enquiries of students or are clearly guided on how best to do so (particularly with regard to an understanding of the needs and skills required to liaise with students with neurodiversity), there is a risk that an over-focus on accademic policies and procedures will endure and that those students who are struggling to adhere to them will be missed or overlooked. 2. It was evident to the Court that very positive steps have already been undertaken in planning towards an \u2018early warning system\u2019 for students in the accademic year 2023\/24. This will allow triggers to be identified and set for accademic absence and changes in study or support behaviours (as is to be trialled in 2023\/24). Such steps are to be commended and I hope will proceed at pace. However, I do have concerns that there is and remains an evident gap between the accademic assessment of students and the pastoral support that they receive. I hope this will be addressed and filled \u2013 in part in the development of staff training and understanding around mental health and in what circumstances concerns should be raised (as above). Where accademic absence or performance issues are identified, I am not convinced, on the evidence heard at this inquest, that enough has yet been done to also consider how \u2018reaching out\u2019 to such students can be most effectively achieved. It was evident that much of the group-focused approaches offered by the universtity or the initaitves where the onus is placed on the student to come forward, may not work. Practically, how best can students \u2013 especially those with neurodiverse needs \u2013 be compassionately and empathetically approached and engaged with to ensure they receive the help and validation that they probably desperately require?  3. The evidence at this inquest raised concerns over the existance, frequency and accuracy of the recording and minueting of accademic meetings with students, especially those between the student and Personal Accademic Tutor and the Project Supervisor in the third year of study. It was of concern to me that the University was unable to locate or provide clear minutes of supervisory catch ups, progress checks or agreed guidance or actions for Matthew. It was of further concern that the accademic staff supporting and mentoring him in his third year had not provided written evidence of his progress or agreed minutes of actions etc to him. Whilst it is recognised, particularly in a third year of study, that there must be a balance between independence and appropriate support, it would in my view be important for any student and university accadenic team to have a clear record of achievement or progress. This must be able to be reflected back to the student and recorded in such a way as to ensure that both student and tutor are clear and agreed as to progress that has been achieved and as to what needs to be done to move forward.

It was however recognised that there may come a time in the future when his risks to himself and others would mean an alternative placement would be needed. 2. When Ben\u2019s risks to himself increased further there were no suitable beds available where he could be cared for in an environment which could meet his needs. He spent several days in an acute hospital bed despite being medically fit for discharge which although, essentially a place of safety, was totally unsuited to his needs. This stay continued whilst discussions ensued regarding where he should be placed. A bed in an acute psychiatric ward was considered but not deemed appropriate to meet his needs and as there were no specialist beds available he was discharged back to his home with increased support as the best option available. Had a bed been available in a specialist unit it is likely that he would not have died when he did. 3. In the evidence provided it became clear that a lot of units where a specialist bed may have been available had been closed in the past due to concerns about the level of care following a number of investigations. This has led to a system whereby locally and nationally there are limited options for those requiring care relating to both the management of autism and self-harm or harm to others, particularly when there is an urgent need for increased support.

Tom was assessed in relation to his mental ill health presentation by the Consultant liaison psychiatrist, but the Trust template was not completed, which was not in compliance with the Trust policy and criticised in the Trust serious incident report. There is a concerning mismatch of what more junior colleagues are expected to do and be trained in, compared with Senior practitioners demonstrated work practises. 2. No letter of discharge was sent at the time Tom was seen by the liaison psychiatry team, and a letter was only generated in response to investigations taking place after the death. The team acknowledged that there were \u201cproblems\u201d with sending out letters at the time, and no evidence was brought before the court that this issue has now been resolved. Letters should be dispatched within 24 hours of attendance. Communication between the various community teams and setting out the treatment plan to the patient are important factors that were not effective during Tom\u2019s care and remain a concerning omission where there may be a simple and effective remedy. 3. It was acknowledged that obtaining collateral information from the family is vital, but in this case was delegated to a very Junior member of the team who was in the early stages of her training. It should be considered if this task is appropriate to delegate, and if so what information should be sought from families\/carers and how that should be effectively used to support patient care. 4. The Trust showed good intentions of reviewing the training programme, but were unable to evidence that planned 6 monthly audits had actually taken place, and so there was no evidence before the court that the new training that had arisen from the serious incident findings was effective. Introducing new training, templates and supervision performance appraisals all seem to be positive interventions, but in the absence of any process to audit their effectiveness, it is concerning that

I received further evidence in writing from the Interested Persons\u2019 subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns. This evidence included responses from Hampshire Constabulary and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the failures identified during the course of the Inquest with respect to concerns at b \u2013 d (above). I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons. I also received evidence from the Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern detailed at a (above). This evidence has not allayed my concern in relation to a (above). In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. Evidence received from the police officers accompanying Mr. EVANS during his attendance at Frimley Park Hospital provided that: a. Mr. EVANS presented with a large fresh cut on his arm and also cuts on his Ryan John EVANS (26975-2018) legs which were identified by him as being from self-harm with hospital staff noting that the larger mark on the arm might require stitching. b. Police officers stated that Mr. EVANS was open with hospital staff about his feelings of self-harm depression, and thoughts of ending his own life. Officers further recalled that hospital staff noticed and commented on the self-harm marks on Mr. EVANS\u2019 arms, including whilst staff were dressing a recent self- harm wound on Mr. EVANS\u2019 left arm. c. Officers also recalled Mr. EVANS commenting when offered food by hospital staff that he would rather starve to death. d. One of the accompanying police officers expressed surprise at the fact that Mr. EVANS was not subject to a mental health referral or assessment, in the context of him commenting to multiple hospital staff members about his self-harm actions and ideation. An emergency department consultant at Frimley Park gave evidence which suggested that no mental health assessment was or would have been necessary where Ryan\u2019s presenting complaint was recorded as chest pains rather than of self- harm and\/or suicidal ideation. Although self-harm had been noted in the records, no explanation could be provided for why Ryan\u2019s suicidal ideation had not been recorded. The consultant was further questioned in relation to the 2006 NICE Guidelines \u201cSelf-Harm: The short term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care\u201d which are national guidelines that ought to feed into practice at the hospital. These guidelines provide that \u201cFollowing triage patients who have self-harmed should receive the requisite treatment for their physical condition, undergo risk and full psychosocial needs assessment and mental state examination, and referral for further treatment and care as necessary\u201d and \u201cAll people who have self harmed should be offered an assessment of needs, which should be comprehensive and include evaluation of the social, psychological and motivational factors specific to the act of self-harm, current suicidal intent and hopelessness, as well as a full mental health and social needs assessment.\u201d Evidence received during the course of the Inquest was not able to reconcile the contradiction between the NICE guidelines on self-harm and Mr. EVANS having had no mental health assessment despite obvious signs of self-harm and further evidence of disclosure of suicidal ideation. The jury in their Narrative Conclusion found that \u2018Despite evidence of self-harm, no mental health assessment was carried out at this point.\u2019 I remain concerned as to how such a situation would be avoided if a patient presented again in similar manner to Mr. EVANS. The additional evidence on PFD matters provided by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust does not refer to or address the NICE guidelines on self-harm or explain what would now be done differently were a patient such as Mr. EVANS were to be seen again. The Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust additional evidence refers to matters being in the process of introduction and new referral criteria with Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, but this does not explain how this would prevent the future risk of a patient such as Mr. EVANS leaving the hospital without a mental health assessment.

partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated she: \"decided to jump down on to the tracks to take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform\". The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police). The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report stated: \"Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with her family\". It was established at Inquest that had the full details of the incident on 25th January 2023 been understood - ie that Denise intended to take her life and this was only prevented by the slowing and halting of the train - that the psychiatrist would have referred her either to the Intensive Home Treatment Team (with consent) or for a Mental Health Act assessment (if no consent had been forthcoming). The Trust's Report stated: \"There were no identified service delivery issues that impacted on the services' ability to offer care and treatment\". However, in oral evidence, the Trust's witness agreed this was inaccurate, following reflection upon the missed opportunities of investigating the events of 25th January 2023. The Trust was unable to provide the Inquest with information to satisfy my concern that the Trust has robust systems in place to avoid the risk that staff may rely upon short summaries from British Transport Police, rather than scrutinising all the information contained within a referral and making relevant inquiries if the reporting is ambiguous or incomplete. In this case, the Trust was clearly of the view that the detail was significant but was overly reliant upon partial information which resulted in missed opportunities for appropriate referral. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe Oxleas NHS Trust has the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15th February 2024. I, the Coroner, may extend the period.

There is a lack of local and national system of in-cell ligature point risk assessments, and no ligature point maps available to staff.  The Prison Staff caring for Wyndham were not aware of the location of knownligature points within the cell. This meant that suspicion was not drawn when Wyndham was seen positioned in an area which had access to a ligature point. 2. There is no mandatory requirement for a HMP Prison to have access to a Safer Cell (one with reduced ligature points). HMP Nottingham does not have designated Safer Cells, including on the Care and Support Unit, where prisoners posing a high risk of harm by ligation may be sent for their own safety. The above matters represent missed opportunities to seek to reduce the risk of self-harm and death by ligature asphyxiation, which is one of the most prevalent mechanisms of self-harm and self-inflicted death across the prison estate. While the above measures will not eliminate risk entirely, any reduction in opportunity to ligate may save

Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Society. (1) The Trust investigation was materially incomplete and there was a lost opportunity to: a. Understand concerns of the Family b. Acknowledge errors and learn lessons from the circumstances of the death. The Director of Operations and Matron informed the Trust Senior Managementthat the PSII Report had omissions. The Trust evidence was that it was an early adopter of the new NHS investigation process. The lead investigator did not report on material issues as to how Morgan-Rose was observed on the ward and the report was significantly delayed. Evidence was there was a pressure to sign the report off although it remained incomplete and did not contain a note about the limitations. c. d. Escalate concerns about staff observations - About 2 weeks after the death the Matron received a report that staff observations had not been appropriately conducted. This prompted a review of CCTV from the afternoon of Morgan-Rose\u2019s death. There was insufficient scrutiny of the CCTV that showed that multiple observations entries made on 6 July 2022 after 14:06 hours could not be correct. e. Understand security issues on a locked mental health ward - It has not been possible to establish the identity of the person that reset the bathroom alert triggered for Morgan-Rose on 6 July 2022 at 15:31. The Trust does not have an accurate records of Trust staff pass allocation. The Trust investigation did not establish that staff borrowed each other\u2019s security passes. On the day of Morgan-Rose\u2019s death a visitor pass issued that had access to the nursing office. The Trust was unable to provide the identity of this person. (2) There was a dispute in evidence over whether it was or was not permitted for patients to have belts on Chelmer Ward, that has not been resolved. a. Morgan-Rose was on 1:1 observation due to her high risk of self- harm that including ligaturing and a belt was in her possession b. The Responsible Clinician and a Ward Manager providing support to 4 staff gave evidence at that time that belts were not permitted c. The Trust senior management stated that belts were permitted and referenced the policy. The Updated ward documentation \u2018Handover Checklist\u2019 approved in October 2023 contains belts on a list of prohibited items. The Trust has stated that this is not correct although this was part of the After-Action Review and is in current use. (3) Escalation of risk \u2013 Morgan-Rose attempted to secure unescorted leave on the morning of her death, her Responsible Clinician had only authorised escorted leave. This was not escalated to the nurse in charge and the Responsible Clinician was not informed. (4) Bathroom alerts \u2013 Evidence was heard that an Oxevision alert is triggered if a person is in the bathroom for more than 3 minutes and staff are required to complete an in-person check. Morgan-Rose was left in the bathroom unobserved for approximately 50 minutes. It was not clear from the evidence how the Trust proposes to ensure compliance in respect of this duty. (5) Trust oversight of care \u2013 the quality of record keeping was acknowledged not to be appropriate by nurses and senior staff during evidence, yet had been signed off: a. Observations sheets for vulnerable detained mental patients were signed off by nurses in charge as being appropriate despite an absence of any recorded therapeutic engagement b. Omissions in the recording of food and fluid charts required by the Responsible Clinician for a patient who was losing weight with a diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder. c. The Responsible Clinician\u2019s evidence was that the absence of appropriate food and fluid charts for other patients was an ongoing issue on Chelmer Ward that had been raised with nursing staff (6) Staff entries in patient observations sheets should have given rise to a concern that some staff may have been using Oxevision not just as an adjunct to face-to-face observations, but instead of them. This remains a concern. 5 Essex County Council (7) There is a significant shortfall of appropriate placements for people with Autism who have mental health and self-harm risks in Essex both inpatient

During the inquest, it became clear that one significant entry in the clinical notes made by someone in a separate service commissioned by the Essex 2 Partnership University Trust, and which expressed a very specific and imminent intention from the deceased to end her life, was not seen by others in the clinical team. This was almost certainly because the clinical record does not present on computer screens as a continuous chronological running record, but is instead viewed thematically. That means that readers are likely to look at entries made within their particular clinical team, rather than see what others have recorded more recently. There is an obvious risk that critical and important information garnered by others and put into the medical records will not be seen, and that those making clinical decisions on risk management will thus be unaware of potentially very significant information. (2) The evidence was such that neither the care co- Ordinator nor the consultant psychiatrist as the medical lead of the service specifically considered the structured risk management tools that the Trust operates, preferring to rely on clinical experience and judgment alone. There may be a risk that not using such risk management tools in combination with clinical experience and judgment, particularly if this is being done by one clinician at an appointment rather than multidisciplinary discussion of changes in presentation, may lead to information being missed. (3) There was also evidence about the measures that the British Transport Police had taken, seeking to provide additional support by setting up multi- agency support plan, which provided a system for alerting a number of people including the deceased\u2019s care- co-ordinator, when she attended at railway stations. In fact, for various reasons, although there are several known attendances at railway stations, none were passed on to the care co- Ordinator. The evidence at the inquest was that British Transport Police does not have the resources always to provide information about attendances at unstaffed stations (although in fact, one such attendance had been known about but was not passed on). The plan as presented does not make it entirely clear what the limitations in relation to information from attendances at unstaffed stations may be, and should it remain the position that BTP lacks the resources to identify all such attendances at railway stations by persons at specific risk of suicide on the railway, there is a risk that those expecting to receive information under such a plan

the inquest, evidence was heard from , one of your salaried GPs as to his interactions with Olivia, and based on the records, his colleagues\u2019 interactions. There was no evidence within the notes that the risk of relapse if a medication is stopped was discussed in either November 2020 or August 2021, nor is there evidence that Olivia was told she may feel worse before she feels better. I did not find that this advice was not given, simply that I could not say either way. When asked, evidence was that you would discuss the risks when prescribing the drug, but was not entirely clear as to which risks he would discuss, and gave evidence that it is likely each GP has a different approach, bearing in mind the time limitations of the appointment. He could not say with confidence that every GP within the practice was discussing these key risks.  A copy of the relevant NICE guidance was provided to me which states that these risks should be discussed with the patient, and I look specifically at sections 1.3.1 and 1.5.2 as a minimum. I am concerned that this guidance is not being followed as a matter of routine within the surgery and that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. I am also concerned that a significant event meeting (acknowledging I may have the name of this review meeting incorrect) has not yet taken place, despite Olivia\u2019s death being over 2 years ago. The evidence of was that this will take place after the inquest and I am concerned that, if this is the practice following all deaths, there is a risk that learning from deaths will be delayed or missed.",["inquest","evidence","heard","one","salaried","gps","interactions","olivia","based","records","colleagues","interactions","evidence","within","notes","risk","relapse","medication","stopped","discussed","either","november","august","evidence","olivia","told","may","feel","worse","feels","better","find","advice","given","simply","could","say","either","way","asked","evidence","would","discuss","risks","prescribing","drug","entirely","clear","risks","would","discuss","gave","evidence","likely","gp","different","approach","bearing","mind","time","limitations","appointment","could","say","confidence","every","gp","within","practice","discussing","key","risks","copy","relevant","nice","guidance","provided","states","risks","discussed","patient","look","specifically","sections","minimum","concerned","guidance","followed","matter","routine","within","surgery","gives","rise","risk","future","deaths","also","concerned","significant","event","meeting","acknowledging","may","name","review","meeting","incorrect","yet","taken","place","despite","olivia","death","years","ago","evidence","take","place","inquest","concerned","practice","following","deaths","risk","learning","deaths","delayed","missed"],["inquest","evidence","hear","one","salaried","gps","interaction","olivia","base","record","colleague","interaction","evidence","within","note","risk","relapse","medication","stop","discuss","either","november","august","evidence","olivia","told","may","feel","bad","feel","well","find","advice","give","simply","could","say","either","way","ask","evidence","would","discuss","risk","prescribe","drug","entirely","clear","risk","would","discuss","give","evidence","likely","gp","different","approach","bear","mind","time","limitation","appointment","could","say","confidence","every","gp","within","practice","discuss","key","risk","copy","relevant","nice","guidance","provide","state","risk","discuss","patient","look","specifically","section","minimum","concerned","guidance","follow","matter","routine","within","surgery","give","rise","risk","future","death","also","concern","significant","event","meeting","acknowledge","may","name","review","meeting","incorrect","yet","take","place","despite","olivia","death","year","ago","evidence","take","place","inquest","concern","practice","follow","death","risk","learn","death","delay","miss"],[-0.0425008126,-0.0048797373,0.0360637344,0.0824898407,-0.0683157295,0.0181882102,0.0978371054,-0.0793083832,0.1166447029,0.0490902439,-0.052880045,-0.1084256396,-0.0095859198,0.0529107377,-0.1014950797,0.0822281092,0.0472048968,0.1075651199,-0.015817998,-0.0939600766,0.0370431356,-0.0368206128,-0.0110646328,0.0417727977,0.0262981094,-0.0017713207,-0.0845660418,0.0318814069,-0.0025919832,-0.0039622579,-0.0052768206,-0.045737274,-0.0295480825,-0.0289798994,-0.036072962,-0.0180185903,0.0725115389,-0.0376305394,0.0183847416,-0.0026349209,0.0556853525,-0.0283529591,0.0545323677,-0.022212835,-0.0461007059,-0.0757192597,-0.0276081767,-0.0064148423,-0.0540534332,0.0500491224,0.0074986303,0.0221483987,-0.0405192412,-0.0145968655,-0.0169565473,-0.0004490106,-0.034771055,-0.0491609797,0.0489211567,-0.0723786429,-0.0597279854,0.0116413319,-0.0636287928,-0.0318747833,-0.0070736906,-0.0284390412,-0.0323682688,0.1089058816,-0.0564294867,0.0357519351,0.0075782952,-0.0097838407,0.1004798338,0.0267322157,-0.1587158889,-0.0396889374,0.0760431811,0.0745062977,0.0903321058,0.1430418044,0.0192211065,-0.0283625107,0.0331995748,0.0118975975,-0.0200491026,-0.067140922,-0.0679071397,0.0797417238,0.0004622585,0.0328641944,0.0982313529,-0.0289271157,-0.0408325195,-0.0584851652,0.0308090337,-0.0761214867,0.0769913569,0.0379642211,0.0339534096,-0.0370219015,0.001199057,-0.0493266955,0.0259243567,0.0208411999,0.0048275734,-0.0715104938,-0.0257380288,-0.0446533002,0.0654687956,-0.053622935,-0.013789406,-0.0275770966,-0.0402825512,-0.0197288226,0.0385229215,-0.0420109965,0.0239104033,-0.0521572605,0.0677000508,0.0646388307,-0.0887664109,0.0349796489,-0.0856067762,0.079427816,-0.0100108301,-0.0535867102,-0.0200808924,-0.0562026165,0.0170445405,0.0679478869,-0.026999658,-0.110863395,-0.0567148775,-0.0137221497,0.0247238521,-0.0723972768,0.0429274701,0.065063715,-0.0131379357,0.0896878615,0.053855896,-0.0004956149,-0.0246981829,-0.0034784125,0.0026996229,-0.0128127988,-0.0375181697,-0.0482170358,-0.0347100794,-0.0261633825,0.065213345,-0.0030106537,-0.0511033423,0.0534521304,0.0082145697,-0.0403894819,-0.040771246,-0.0435871743,-0.0799551085,-0.0262221694,0.0192523338,0.1042730063,0.0368890986,-0.0252551883,-0.0115351714,-0.0557648428,0.0460375398,-0.0319938064,0.011704674,-0.0143093728,-0.0432984419,-0.0174125265,-0.0587625727,-0.0700820833,0.0304162074,-0.0886283666,0.1040739343,-0.0425247736,-0.0402928144,0.0003952795,-0.0601229705,-0.0468450747,0.0261082612,-0.0106249079,-0.0293557812,-0.0003370536,-0.0366156809,0.0331858546,0.077195704,0.0691397041,0.0213427506,-0.012990227,-0.0001723415,-0.0087628029,0.0036468655,0.0088419

summary of matters of concern) In relation to Ofsted and\/or the Department for Education 1. The first of these relates to my hypothetical schools A and B point, referred to above. I am concerned about the impact on school leader welfare that this system may continue to have. Transparency and ease of message to parents is not currently weighed against teacher welfare. The current system allows a school which is inadequate in all areas to receive the same overall label as a school which is good in all areas, but with some safeguarding issues which can be repaired by the time the report is published. Regulation 28 \u2013 Before Inquest Document Template Updated 30\/07\/2020 2. There is an almost complete absence of Ofsted training or published policy in the following areas: a. Signs of distress in school leaders during an inspection (this will be obvious to some, but not to all). b. Practical steps to deal with such distress. c. Pausing an inspection by reason of the distress of a school leader. d. Who can attend meetings with the inspectors during the inspection process. 3. Absence of a clear path to raise concerns during an inspection if these cannot be resolved directly with the lead inspector. 4. The confidentiality requirement after an inspection. Some changes have been made already, but this is not yet written into policy. Given how long this policy has been in place, school leaders may fear discussing outcomes with colleagues outside of the school, and mental health professionals, unless this is expressly dealt with in written policy. 5. Timescales for report publication. 6. No learning review of these matters was conducted by Ofsted. There is no policy requiring this to be done. 7. In an Ofsted publication dated 12th of June 2023, the Secretary of State for Education was quoted as follows: \u201cWe must ensure our school leaders have the support they need, which is why today we are significantly expanding our wellbeing support. This expansion will help make sure headteachers have access to support whenever they need it\u201d. The Ofsted witness was not able to clarify what form this additional support has taken. Reading Borough Council 1. Reading Borough Council indicated an intention to adopt a much more robust and proactive approach to dealing with Ofsted, particularly where there are concerns about an inspection. This is not in written policy or guidance \u2013 which may go some way towards reassuring school leaders that their employer \u2018has their back\u2019 \u2013 both now and in future years. 2. Reading Borough Council also did not carry out any form of internal review. I was not made aware of any policy setting out when such an internal review should take place. 3. We heard in evidence that school leaders have received correspondence from Reading Borough Council about what mental health support options are available.

the Trust having prepared a detailed report and addendum for my consideration after the inquest I am still concerned about the-following: (1) Paul Perrott\u2019s observations charts were not filled

Michael was taken to St George\u2019s Hospital, he explained that he had been back and forth from the l railway station, each He was discharged with a plan for follow up by the community mental health team (CMHT). I was told that the local CMHT meets at the beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an appointment is made, so it was likely that Michael would have to wait an absolute minimum of a week to be seen. In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer him to the crisis team. Michael\u2019s family knew nothing of his mental ill health. He declined an invitation by the nurse assessing him to contact them. He did not want to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic benefits of the input of a patient\u2019s loved ones, the assessing nurse did not in any way try to persuade Michael to allow her to do this. The first that Michael\u2019s family heard of Michael\u2019s mental ill health was when they heard of his death. I am sure that, had they been made aware of it while he was still alive, they would have done everything in their power to support him and to engage with the mental health services. Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services have not done enough to try to bring them in to a patient\u2019s care. In spite of the frequency of this occurrence, the lesson does not seem to be being learnt.

this case exposes the total inadequate level of community provision for the care and treatment of those with suffering with Autism. This is a national problem and sadly leads to  many experiencing unnecessary admissions to inpatient mental health facilities and also A&E attendances. Despite a report from the Health and Social Care committee from 2021 this case showed that there does not seem to have been any real improvement and more lives are likely to be lost. Reading from this report, it says \u201cThe conclusion of this report was that Autistic people (and people with learning disabilities) have the right to live independent, free, and fulfilled lives in the community and it is an unacceptable violation of their human rights to deny them the chance to do so.\u201d The report identified that \u201cthe community support and provision for autistic people (and those with learning difficulties) and financial investment in those services is significantly below the level required to meet the needs of those individuals and to provide adequate support for them in the community. \u201c The Inquest heard that two years on there still remains an acute shortage of provision. Evidence was heard that East Sussex Council had tried over 30 providers to help put in place support for Jessie but they could not find a placement for her so the only provision that they were able to offer her was supported housing with temporary care agency staff. This provision broke down which exsacerbated Jessie\u2019s mental health.

administration of from day four of Katie's hospital new admissions reprecipitated her serotonin syndrome and directly contributed to her death. The Trust has recognised this and amended its sedation policy to recommend \"lower risk\" opiates (such as morphine) are used in patients who have taken overdoses of medications wherethere is a risk of serotonin syndrome \/ toxicity. It is accepted that the way the interacted in this case was unexpected, and appears to have occurred due to the particular circumstances of Katie's case; in particular an aspiration pneumonia requiring treatment in the prone position, and the development of a paralytic ileus. However, these complications are not unusual in patients who have taken overdoses of these types of medications and as such I consider there is a risk a future death may occur in similar circumstances. I am concerned that other NHS organisations may not fully appreciate the risks associated with the use of in patients such as Katie and that this information should be shared with those organisations

It was recognised in evidence and in submission to the View Court by representatives of the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental health and physical health services, with little inter-service connectivity. It was recognised that ideally services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should be connecting in a seamless, timely and collaborative manner - specifically through the joint commissioning of services, to support patients of all ages. Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB - Project Fusion I understand is such an example - much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients. It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area - save for private clinics, which many cannot afford. The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented. 2. Evidence before this inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised that the mental health provision for those with personality disorders must move towards an individual, therapeutic and trauma-informed approached, which is both compassionate and recovery focused. It is evident that the 'Personality Disorder Pathway' currently being developed is an important step towards that, enabling practitioners and services to take a more holistic and person-centred approach, reducing risk and improving outcomes. I am aware that SHFT have been encouraged to review and further develop the Pathway. I am concerned that that must occur, and at pace. 3. I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being suffiently, effectively and meaningfuly listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatement or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions. There remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only responses. It is recognised that patients can present quite differently to and in the presence of their families, who know them intimately, to how they may (or may be able to) present to assessing clinicians - with or without the intent to mask their condition. Whilst consent to share is an understandable barrier in some cases, there should not be a bar to listening to or to actively encouraging feedback and input from families, especially where a family's concerns are heightened by any sudden or marked changes in the behaviours, mood or presentation of their relative outside of the clinical\/assessment environment - particularly in the case of neurodiversity. Unless all concerns are heard and considered and all availble information is taken on board, holistically, there is a continuing risk that the masking of mental health conditions and the deterioration of them may occur or that significant red flags are missed. In this case, the family\u2019s increasingly desperate concerns voiced about their daughter's evident mental health deterioration in her final days went un-responded. 4. Finally, I am concerned that more needs to be done to inform and assist families, particularly in cases of patients with neurodiversity. In this particular case, the evidence found, for example, that the family were never briefed on what EUPD and ADHD really meant or on the difficulties which could present as a result of their daughter\u2019s joint diagnoses. Being unaware as to what they were to expect, they were consequetnly often at a loss to know how to interact with or to help her.

The notes made by the SPoE Nurse for use during discussion at the screening MDT meeting did not include any reference to the report of a recent suicide attempt and the Court was not satisfied that the risk of suicide had been identified or recognised by the SPoE Nurse (2) The Court heard that the practice at the screening MOT meeting was for the SPoE Nurse to read out the contents of the referral to the Psychiatrist who would then advise on next steps. There was no evidence to show that any form of meaningful multi-team discussion took place at the screening MDT meeting (3) There was no direct contact between the mental health team and the Deceased (either by telephone or in person) before the decision to reject the referral was made (4) The Consultant Psychiatrist present at the MDT meeting has no recollection of discussing the referral and whilst the evidence was that a letter to the GP practice explaining the reason for rejecting the referral was generated there is no record of this letter on the Trust's electronic systems or having been received by the GP practice 6 7 8 (5) The evidence was that there is no member of staff allocated to deal with referrals when the SPoE Nurse is absent from work which means that during their absence, urgent referrals are not being reviewed. (6) There is currently no Standard Operating Procedure on how referrals into the SPoE Older Adults should be managed (7) There is currently no system by which the management of referrals into the SPoE and related decision-making are audited. As such there is a risk that poor quality decision-making is going unchecked.

Despite recognising Mr Malone needed to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital in June 2023 but there was no bed capacity, BSMHFT\u2019 RCA report identified no remedial action. 2. The Patient Safety Manager gave evidence that the lack of psychiatric bed capacity remains an ongoing problem and has not been resolved, and there is a genuine risk of the same problem with another patient in the future. 3. added there was an exceptional process, which required a considered decision at a high level, to make a bed available through identifying someone currently occupying a bed space to be discharged. In my view, this process is unsatisfactory as it creates a different set of risks around the patient being discharged, and amplifies the chronic shortage of beds. 4. There was reference to two preceding Regulation 28 Reports to Prevent Future Deaths (both available publicly on the judiciary website) that focussed on the chronic lack of mental health resources in Birmingham and Solihull. In relation to the specific issue of a lack of psychiatric bed capacity, in the case of Peter Fleming (no bed was available in August 2022) BSMHFT\u2019s response (September 2023) referred to their response in the earlier case of Leroy Hamilton (no bed was available in December 2021). This response (April 2023) stated more resources had been obtained and a collaborative plan had been implemented with NHS Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board. The issue of adequately funding psychiatric beds is a local and national issue. Locally, BSMHFT require their commissioners to provide the necessary funding. My principal concern is that the above dates indicate available psychiatric bed capacity in Birmingham and Solihull remains inadequate. Whilst some action may have been taken it is insufficient to resolve the problem.

During the Inquest evidence was heard that: \u00ad i. During the period from the 25th of October 2022 to the 4th of January 2023 there were no visits from a Care Coordinator, or a Community Psychiatric Nurse, and all the 2-week planned visits did not take place, so that 4 or 5 visits were missed. ii. There was no appointment of an interim Care Coordinator or a Community Psychiatric Nurse to cover the 2 weekly planned appointments following the absence of YL. iii. There was no responsibility on a Duty officer to review planned appointments during the absence of a Care Coordinator and to arrange for a Community Psychiatric Nurse to attend any planned appointments. iv. There were no resilience plans in place to cover the absence of a Care Coordinator, either in relation to short term or long- term absences. 2. I request that the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust reviews their procedures and policies to cover the absence of a Care Coordinator, both in relation to short term and long-term absences, and in relation to the appointment of an interim Care Coordinator. 3. I further request that the Trust reviews their procedures and policies in relation to the responsibility of a Duty officer to review planned appointments during the absence of a Care Coordinator and to arrange for a Community Psychiatric Nurse to attend any planned appointments. 4.

summary of matters of concern) ACCT documents In evidence at the inquest ACCT assessers and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64\/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They weree not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on \u2018remaining\u2019 risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger. This leads me to have 2 concerns: The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a \u2018whole prison\u2019 document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff. In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force. The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question. Information sharing. In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to. Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings. In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntley\u2019s care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff. of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now  carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team. could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate. My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered. Cells At HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the \u2018mental health\u2019 cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points. It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28\/05\/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the \u2018mental health cells\u2019 simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the \u2018mental health cells\u2019 at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments. However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so. I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm. The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64\/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and\/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.  6 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by July 09, 2023.

28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower. Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern. 1. On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team. 2. Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died. 3. The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub. 4. She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igor\u2019s care and welfare. 5. Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family. I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igor\u2019s death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest. However, I have read the report since. It went into some detail and identified that, when Igor was found at 6.25pm, no staff member had undertaken a welfare check of him since half past midnight, whereas there should have been at least one per shift. I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igor\u2019s death. At the time of Igor\u2019s death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance. The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory.

During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge in mental health distress was raised. There is a minimum of 2 staff in the control room and 3 staff covering \u201ctraffic duties\u201d on the ground. The security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however this report only seeks to address their role in relation to those suffering from mental health distress. The staff are expected to identify and monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge. This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them. It appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure that staff are given appropriate training to deal with identifying vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an 8 weeks mentoring course, whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on what to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety harness\/working at height training. However there appeared to be no structure to any of the training for this vital role and of more concern there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant 3 knowledge of working with those suffering from mental health crisis. Nor was there any current input with regard to how to talk and negotiate with people in crisis. I was informed that there were many very competent staff who had good intuition, but I have concerns that without appropriate and structured input from a health care professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable foundations. It was evident that the role is vitally important in identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis then the difficult job of assessing people and reacting appropriately with them becomes very difficult. (2) While the \u201cRight Care\/Right Person\u201d process appears to ensure that the correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health support. (3) I am aware that there is a Suicide Prevention Meeting where a multi-agency approach can be taken to address the reduction of suicide . I consider that this may be the correct forum to recognise the unique role the staff play and implement a structured training plan with all agencies input for any person beginning work in that role. (4) I was informed in evidence that a vulnerable person is escorted off the bridge everyday \u2013 this shows the extent of the problem and the staff to be provided with the very best training available. I echo the views of Lizzie\u2019s family when talking about the role that the Security Staff have \u201cthere is so much responsibility on someone\u2019s head, for them to decide whether someone is likely to jump or not\u201d.

The concern here is that this site & potentially similar self-harm & suicide \u201cfacilitating, or promoting\u201d sites are accessible\/available to those, such as BM who are vulnerable, due to their diagnosed, or otherwise mental illness & provided with an outlet\/forum to source & acquire information that potentially equips them with the knowledge & means to either complete suicide, or place them in grave\/greater danger of doing so. I believe that consideration ought to be given to the impact such access\/availability has upon those vulnerable individuals researching\/contemplating acts of self-harm & whether, & what action(s) may be taken to remove\/limit\/mitigate\/educate such access\/availability.",["evidence","revealed","least","february","bm","registered","engaging","discussion","forums","website","mentioned","earlier","pfd","report","dated","copy","annexed","engagement","bm","website","encompassed","discussing","seeking","advice","fellow","users","respect","methods","including","purchasing","use","substance","substance","used","bm","led","death","concern","site","potentially","similar","suicide","facilitating","promoting","sites","bm","vulnerable","due","diagnosed","otherwise","mental","illness","provided","source","acquire","information","potentially","equips","knowledge","means","either","complete","suicide","place","danger","believe","consideration","ought","given","impact","upon","vulnerable","individuals","acts","whether","action","may","taken"],["evidence","reveal","least","february","bm","register","engaging","discussion","forum","website","mention","earlier","pfd","report","date","copy","annexed","engagement","bm","website","encompass","discuss","seek","advice","fellow","user","respect","method","include","purchasing","use","substance","substance","use","bm","lead","death","concern","site","potentially","similar","suicide","facilitate","promote","site","bm","vulnerable","due","diagnose","otherwise","mental","illness","provide","source","acquire","information","potentially","equip","knowledge","mean","either","complete","suicide","place","danger","believe","consideration","ought","give","impact","upon","vulnerable","individual","act","whether","action","may","take"],[-0.0213130079,-0.0036042042,0.0234527588,0.0366386995,-0.0933591425,0.0493469238,0.080306612,-0.0361498334,0.1295648217,0.0009769538,-0.070809193,-0.1020363048,-0.0327677615,0.0710097104,-0.0476481132,0.0554085746,-0.0045223846,0.1074373275,-0.0195980314,-0.0736232623,0.0479885004,-0.0579403602,-0.0276886374,0.0740395561,0.0007838714,-0.0314557962,-0.0371298194,0.060762845,-0.0094581014,-0.0212672316,-0.004631727,-0.0660804883,-0.099955827,-0.0384443216,-0.0303955078,-0.0229287762,0.0348515138,-0.0204765126,0.0445421673,-0.0059838905,0.0446767546,0.0295938347,0.0396615043,0.0316834077,-0.0233478062,-0.1180788949,-0.0224720873,0.00365448,-0.0640433878,0.0640285164,0.0169064701,0.0217336025,-0.0363166034,-0.0569428653,-0.0085220337,0.0532644205,-0.0568123832,-0.0918015689,0.0278927609,-0.0720672607,-0.014138246,-0.0188451149,-0.0534261055,0.0000596658,-0.0534820557,-0.0136192515,-0.0589861013,0.0914611816,-0.0249208789,0.0571785942,-0.0060676672,-0.0009152828,0.1256603301,0.0283815432,-0.0623708889,-0.0739036947,0.0593725368,0.0505684577,0.0501087867,0.1134819612,0.0273220353,-0.0481741503,0.0095532276,0.0478419773,0.026671581,-0.0378689878,-0.0658420697,0.0633949861,0.0141666122,0.0410748012,0.0818684921,-0.0475426689,-0.0323918648,-0.0727931261,0.0732428208,-0.0767415389,0.0482341312,0.0241983365,0.054214675,-0.0047220085,0.0139680523,-0.0209857263,0.0153395338,0.0206198078,-0.0203815363,-0.0927178785,-0.0628511459,-0.0409960635,0.0324169062,-0.048602201,-0.0517529212,-0.0232964549,-0.0388028547,-0.049044095,0.0561222173,0.0012580676,0.0183778424,0.0016831618,0.1185946316,0.0745191798,-0.0402325355,0.0335075185,-0.0953903198,0.0647618249,-0.0183379836,-0.0287944116,-0.0465156361,-0.0558296591,0.0465788245,0.0637479946,-0.0100082988,-0.0983186364,-0.0797645375,0.0451702215,0.0086676767,-0.0584902652,0.0198628474,-0.0103800846,-0.0196291842,0.056355793,0.0418862551,-0.0110319089,-0.0551456548,-0.0042697224,0.0347690098,-0.0219611134,-0.0427492596,-0.0185711198,-0.0801592097,-0.0267785881,0.0984019712,-0.018239731,-0.0201403294,-0.024369264,0.0157912504,-0.0796868727,-0.0292372089,-0.0774506778,-0.0763342455,-0.0305095576,0.0497831702,0.1139849126,0.0016510793,-0.0225894637,-0.0273200795,-0.0499091521,0.0448016636,-0.0244468786,-0.0203603115,-0.0069560516,-0.0309618432,-0.0498250313,-0.0289263595,-0.0999317691,0.0250181537,-0.0545087978,0.0754319206,-0.0757655129,-0.055636283,-0.0207873117,-0.0698570088,-0.0634941682,-0.0035631228,-0.0113552781,-0.0151560614,-0.0163766909,-0.0589068979,0.0367841981,0.0699748471,0.0596104153,-0.0043037608,-0.0006283491,-0.0012077919,-0.0176412147,-0.0165510904,0.0280476101,0.0141578084,-0.0379564352,0.024747042,-0.1258983165,0.0316256024,0.0602712147,-0.0817810446,0.0021287967,-0.0193450153,-0.0330110714,-0.0099367974,-0.004238911,0.0033144827,-0.0361373127,0.0134694027,0.0274763834,-0.0344527811,0.0589849763,-0.0927407667,-0.0114169484,0.0831984505,-0.0080695515,-0.0436086394,-0.0154828783,-0.0057692896,-0.0045659235,-0.0127903866,-0.0024151925,0.0380064026,-0.0446098521,0.0581267923,-0.0129061965,0.0186409578,0.0165667664,0.0362235829,0.0106846737,0.0174177121,-0.0120399669,0.0863432288,-0.0317216516,0.0622632913,-0.0401194133,0.0969619751,-0.0215397738,-0.0142823244,-0.0059047602,0.0422167666,-0.0408804007,0.0255396925,0.0300800614,-0.008762653,0.0938528478,0.0226688869,-0.0583950914,0.0017074194,0.0769228786,-0.0021203847,0.0339562818,0.0426017568,-0.0315690637,0.021071214

The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner\u2019s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased\u2019s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be\u2019 likely end of July\/August time\u2019. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the \u2018end of September\/beginning of October\u2019 and that the initial dates given were \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased\u2019s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author\u2019s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due \u2018end of September\/beginning of October\u2019. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October. (2) The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again. (3) If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah\u2019s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive. (4) I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of \u201cserious incident\u201d investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths. (5) I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust\u2019s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a

(3) The conversation between the Practitioner and the Deceased took place through an observationhatch in circumstances where no risk was posed to the Practitioner from being in the same room as the Deceased. This was not best practice. (4) The terminology used by the Practitioner was misleading in that it suggested that there was no role for the liaison and Diversion service because no unmet needs or vulnerabilities had been identified. The evidence was that the Deceased had declined consent for an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities and therefore the notes should have made clear that an assessment of unmet needs and vulnerabilities had not taken place. (5) The 'review' undertaken by a Health & Justice Operational Manager of the West Mercia Health & Justice Service consisted of duplication of the Practitioners statement with no comment, observations or identification of areas of learning.

The use of Custodial Nurse Practicians (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency. 2. The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process.

some of the outstanding issues are addressed satisfactorily.less action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 1. Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as \u201ccausative matters\u201d in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases. Timing of IS91 notification. 2. The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (\u201cFNOs\u201d) by notification at this stage. Signposting legal advice about immigration matters 3. Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020. 4. I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted. 5. In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion. Communication between agencies 6. Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs. 7. I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of \u201cprison offender managers\u201d who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs. Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information. 8. I am concerned at the potential impact of delays\/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos\u2019 case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos\u2019 case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report. 9. I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (\u201cIPTs\u201d). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information. The SSHD Internal report 10. The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos\u2019 case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed. 11. The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos\u2019 case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction. 12. This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been. Opening cell doors at night 13. In evidence there was a continued misunderstanding that the policy did not apply to Operational Support Grade (OSG) officers and it was understood that they should never open cell doors at night. This was despite the PPO report dated December 2021 (at paragraph 73) requesting this be addressed. 14. The prison stated in PFD evidence that all staff will be instructed as to the policy in terms of opening cell doors at night (which requires a dynamic risk assessment). 15.

Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate.has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs. Staffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time. Healthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today. Following the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward. I was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward. Some three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers. Although initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work. The evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.

I have previously issued a number of Prevention of Future Death Reports relating to quality and timeliness of investigation. b. The Health Board\u2019s Transfer of Care document at the time the transfer occurred did not include any detail or process as to how the transfer should occur.

received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who dealt with the investigation into the allegation against Mr Leger, and from an investigator from the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in particular the consideration of Mr Leger\u2019s welfare and support offered to him. 3 I heard evidence: \u2022 That when a person who has been RUI\u2019d is charged, standard practice (in accordance with current Metropolitan Police policies and procedures) is for that charge to be communicated to them via a PCR with no advance warning. \u2022 That this is the case regardless of the offence, or seriousness of the offence, with which they are being charged. \u2022 That in exceptional circumstances, where an individual is considered to be in a high-risk category, arrangements can be made for the PCR to be delivered in person and\/or for a third party to be present to provide support. \u2022 That it is recognised that certain types of allegation, such as a sexual allegation (as was the case here), may carry a higher risk. This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged (by way of a PCR). \u2022 That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the OIC proactively to seek this information. \u2022 That there is no formal process for assessing an individual\u2019s mental health and\/or risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of delivery of a PCR. It is important to note the following: \u2022 At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard. \u2022 Many people are RUI\u2019d. As such, PCR is now routinely used to bring most criminal charges. \u2022 Individuals who have been RUI\u2019d can remain with this status for long periods of time (months or years) before a decision is made whether or not to charge them. \u2022 Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individual\u2019s mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend a police station for interview, once they have left the police station there are no such formal procedures (as above), notwithstanding 4 the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time they last attended a police station and the time that they are charged. \u2022 Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently, have a significant deleterious effect on an individual\u2019s mental health. It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess, at the time of being charged, an individual\u2019s mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR (potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUI\u2019d and potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm). In Mr Leger\u2019s case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of the Metropolitan Police.

Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced. The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern. The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country. There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams. The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor. The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 \u2013 12 per week. The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week. There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar

Smith was recognised to be a hoarder and her council property was dangerously full of items blocking all access, impeding stair access and impacting on her ability to access the kitchen or bathroom. The gas supply had been cut off as she did not allow access for the annual inspection. Mrs Smith recognized she had a problem and asked the council for assistance. The offered solution only moved some of her belongings into a local \"void\" property that she did not have access to with no plan for how to resolve this temporary situation, creating considerable anxiety and stress for Mrs Smith who then took her own life by overdosing with her prescribed medication (1) The inquest identified that there was insufficient staff training to deal with complex hoarder cases. (2) Other safety assessments such as a fire assessment and\/or environmental health assessment were not requested despite their being a clear need. (3) The council \"flow chart\" was clearly not fit for purpose to assist staff in progressing hoarder support and assistance and was focussed on enforcement procedures rather than tenant support. The inquest was advised that the council's approach was not enforcement, but their documentation did not support this. (4) It was entirely unclear what options were available (if any) when the first plan of assistance completely failed, leaving the vulnerable tenant excluded from her property with no forward plan. 6 7 8 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Hillingdon Council have the power to take such action.

Following his arrest, and before he was interviewed about the alleged offence of murder, Mr. Harris was assessed by a consultant forensic psychiatrist, . Although concluded that Mr. Harris was fit to be detained and fit to be interviewed, he did note possible symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, likely due to some trauma in Mr. Harris\u2019 background, possible symptoms of a personality disorder, and \u201cpotentially a psychotic process, with potential underlying delusional beliefs\u201d; 2 (2) During his police interview on 14.5.22, when describing his movements before the alleged murder had taken place, Mr. Harris told officers he had , intending to jump off in order to take his own life, but had decided against it because \u201cI thought no, I\u2019ve got to reveal all this first\u201d; (3) Despite the fact that these comments revealed very recent suicidal ideation on Mr. Harris\u2019 part, no mention of them appears to have been made in any of the following documents: (a) The Person Escort Record ( PER ) and Suicide and Self-Harm ( SASH ) Warning forms which accompanied Mr. Harris from police custody at Haverfordwest Police Station to Haverfordwest Magistrates\u2019 Court on 16.5.22; (b) The PER and SASH Warning forms which accompanied Mr. Harris from Haverfordwest Magistrates\u2019 Court to HMP Swansea later that same day. (4) Although I was quite satisfied that the omission of these comments from the above documents made no difference to the sad outcome in this case, I am concerned that the failure by Dyfed-Powys Police officers to realise that such comments ought to be included on a PER and SASH Warning form, if repeated in future, may lead to a person in custody\u2019s risk of suicide and\/or self-harm,

The inquest heard evidence that Miss Zarins had suffered with depression since 2008. She managed this by taking anti-depressant medication intermittently, she stopped taking her anti-depressants in June\/July 2021. Miss Zarins came under the care of Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (\u201cLPT\u201d) on 22 November 2021, after taking an intentional overdose the day before. Miss Zarins was initially under the care of LPT\u2019s Mental Health Liaison team but was transferred to the care of LPT\u2019s CRISIS Team when she returned to her home address on 22 November 2021. Miss Zarins expressed a desire to work with the CRISIS team and to recommence anti-depressants as soon as possible in order to improve her mental health. On 23 November 2021 Miss Zarins was discussed at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (\u201cMDT\u201d) meeting at LPT. The discussions at that meeting were fundamentally flawed, as was the plan for Miss Zarins\u2019 care moving forward that was formed at that meeting and then implemented. The meeting proceeded on the basis that Miss Zarins was on, and had been on, anti-depressant medication at the time of taking the overdose, this was incorrect. The second and final MDT meeting where Miss Zarins was discussed (on 24 November 2021) also proceeded on this same mistaken basis. Despite Miss Zarins verbalising both her desire to get more sleep and her desire to go back onto anti-depressants as soon as possible, neither sleeping tablets nor anti-depressants were prescribed to her by LPT before she died. LPT continued to advise Miss Zarins that she would have to wait until 30 November 2021 to have a medical review. A member of LPT staff who was present at both MDT meetings informed the inquest that he did not have time to read the notes of the patients that were to be discussed at the MDT meetings. The staff member had not read Miss Zarins\u2019 core assessment documentation (which correctly stated she was not on any anti-depressants) before either MDT meeting. Evidence heard at inquest was that Miss Zarins should have been put back onto anti\u00ad depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets on 23 November 2021. LPT undertook a Serious Incident Investigation into the care provided to Miss Zarins before her death. The investigation was wholly inadequate. Issues include, but are not limited to: 1. There was no medical input into the investigation; 2. The investigation failed to explore appropriately the functionality of the MDT meetings;  3. The investigation failed to identify the error in understanding of the Miss Zarins\u2019 medication position; 4. Due to the fact that the investigation failed to identify the error relating to the understanding of the medication position, the investigation also failed to identify the fact that the treatment plan that was implemented was flawed. The investigation failed to identify the fact that Miss Zarins should have been recommenced on anti\u00ad depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets before her death. Notwithstanding the inadequacy of the Serious Incident report the document accepts that, whilst the anti-depressants would not have had an immediate impact on Miss Zarins\u2019 mood, the thought of having to wait a week for this medication may have added to her sense of hopelessness. This was echoed by witnesses at the inquest. I also accept, on the balance of probabilities, and when considered alongside Miss Zarins\u2019 clear desire to recommence her anti-depressants in order to get better, that the fact she was told she had to wait a week for a medical review would have added to her sense of hopelessness. Concerns 1) I am concerned about the CRISIS team MDT meetings and their functionality. It is difficult to understand how a meeting attended by around 7 people agreed a treatment plan which was based upon incorrect information relating to the patient\u2019s medication status. This is particularly difficult to understand when the correct medication status is clearly documented in the patient\u2019s core assessment paperwork (which was completed by the Liaison Team on 22 November 2021 and sent to the CRISIS Team). An LPT staff member was candid about the fact that he did not have enough time to review patients\u2019 records before the MDT meetings, this is a grave concern. 2) I remain concerned about both the standard of documentation and lack of documentation relating to the discussion of Miss Zarins at the two MDT meetings. The Trust were only able to provide me with documentation relating to one of the two MDT meetings. That documentation is incorrectly completed and lacks detail. In particular, there is no detail about medication despite there being a specific box within which to document this. This problem of poor and\/or missing documentation is not a risk that is limited to the CRISIS Team, it is one that could have ramifications not only across the Trust but across all of the bodies who come together to provide care for patients. 3) I remain gravely concerned about the inadequacies in the Serious Incident Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust. The Serious Incident Investigation failed to identify the errors in the care provided to Miss Zarins making the use of the process somewhat otiose in this case. The failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where errors in care were uncovered for the first time at inquest, which took place some 20 months after the date of death (due to witness availability). I am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the care  provided to Miss Zarins before her death has caused a delay to, and led to missed opportunities (for some staff) to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety. My concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust Serious Incident Investigations and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the CRISIS Team.

detailed review of the evidence in this case, which included evidence from two Schools ( ), as well as from Bradford Children's Social Services, the TRACKS Education team (at Bradford Council), the SCIL Team and the Council's SEND Team, revealed that no one person or department at  Bradford Council had an overview of Council's involvement in relation to Leah (prior to her death). Of greater concern was that that remained so after each of the Council departments involved were notified that Leah had passed away. Every organisation which had contact with the Coroner's service in relation to Leah's death, with the exception of Bradford Council, was able to provide the Court with an overview\/analysis of their involvement with Leah prior to her death and (where appropriate) the lessons they had learnt as a result their involvement with Leah. The Police and the local Mental Health Trust were examples of two public bodies who had and were able to provide an overview\/analysis to the Court in terms of their involvement with Leah and confirm whether there were any lessons to be learned by them. The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were involved with Leah, showed a clear disconnect in the involvement of the various Council departments. That was not caused by those individuals who had provided written statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide oral evidence. Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actions\/omissions on the part of individuals\/teams within the Council which more than minimally, negligibly or trivially contributed to Leah's death, the concern is that Bradford Council appeared not to have a system\/process in place which allowed anyone (whether an individual \/ a team) within the Council to have an overview of deaths where there had been previous Council involvement with the deceased (in this case a child). In the apparent absence of such oversight Bradford Council would not be able to learn lessons from such cases (or even know if there were lessons to be learned). The absence of such a single point of oversight as was apparent in Leah's case, contributes to the risk that future deaths could occur unless action is

Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to when, where and by (or between) whom any formal handover of responsibility as Care Coordinator (CC) for Jo took a place as between a number of CCs allocated to Jo over a period of many months from the lead up to and following the events.lowing her discharge as an in-patient back to the community team on December 18th 2020 and through to early May 2021. 2. Consequently , the evidence confirmed, despite her clear vulnerabilities, Jo did not have an allocated Care Coordinator for several weeks up to the beginning of May 2021. The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records. 3. Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians\/staff, has the responsibility for oversight of patient care 2 6 7 8 9 following discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event ofrelapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place\/has not been replaced. Please note that this 3rd concern was previously raised by me with CEO of EPUT (and in very similar terms) in a PFDR dated 25.02.2022 following the death of Stephanie Moyce. 4. The community Risk Assessment, Care Plan and Security Plan for Jo were not updated by a Care Coordinator between December 2020 and Jo's death. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.

There continues to be a chronic lack of resources to treat seriously mentally ill patients in Birmingham and Solihull. In the summer of 2022 Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (\u2018BSMHFT\u2019) wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit, however, no bed was available, and he remained in the ;community. Shortly before his death, the deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act. There was no available \u2018place of safety\u2019 and he had to be taken to an emergency department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital Drs agreed the deceased needed to be assessed under the mental health act, however Birmingham City Council could not provide an approved mental health practitioner (\u2018AMPH\u2019) to attend in a 24-hour period. When the section 136 lapsed the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health nurse. At the time of his death the deceased was on BSMHFT\u2019s waiting list for a care- coordinator. The lack of care-coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, \u2018place of safety\u2019, and AMHPs, presents a risk seriously mentally ill people are not receiving necessary treatment. The evidence is that these issues are a consequence of a chronic lack of resources at a local and national level. The Birmingham and Solihull coroners have been repeating identical concerns in Prevention of Future Death Reports for many years. 2. BSMHFT utilizes self-contained specialist teams. The deceased was treated by (a) crisis team\/home treatment team, (b) community mental health team, and (b) psychiatric liaison team. The evidence demonstrated communication between the specialist teams was not effective and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse that reviewed the deceased updated the community mental health team. However, the GP could not prescribe the deceased\u2019s medication in October 2022 because it had not been approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA and the deceased went without his medication. The deceased\u2019s GP had to contact the community mental health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurse\u2019s involvement. The deceased cited this delay as making his mental health worse shortly before his death. My concern is communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFT\u2019s RCA action plan is to seek assurance from the CCG\/ICB that communication between the specialist teams is being strengthened. My concern is that this does not go far enough and there should be consideration of a formal process or policy. 3. Carbamazepine management was proposed in 2012 to manage the deceased\u2019s mental health however this was not picked up by his GP and was only noted by a BSMHFT consultant in August 2022. Therefore, the deceased went 10 years without this medication. BSMHFT could not explain at the inquest why this omission had not been identified sooner. BSMHFT\u2019s RCA action plan does not have any action to avoid a repeat occurrence. My concern is this issue indicates a problem with process and systems and further consideration is required to avoid a repeat occurrence. 4. The deceased\u2019s GP raised concerns that different health organisations use different digital systems that do not communicate with each other. Further, GPs often do not get important patient updates from primary care organisations for many days or weeks. (See examples above: the GP did not pick up the carbamazepine prescription, and could not prescribe the medication in October 2022). My concern is communication between different health organisations is not as effective as it could be and important information is being missed, and consequently a material delay in treatment is occurring. 5. The deceased\u2019s GP raised concerns that current resources do not allow GPs to pro- actively check patients are collecting prescribed medication due to excessive patient lists. My concern is that this is a consequence of lack of resources at a national level. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 6 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 September 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton\u2019s gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and\/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and\/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time. During the \u2018relevant period\u2019 examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton\u2019s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as \u2018player protection tools\u2019, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him. Concerns 1) I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler. 2) I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally. 3) I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to  become problem

At the inquest I was referred to the National Confidential Enquiry into Suicides. I was informed that the Enquiry identified key factors that should be adopted by Health Organisations to reduce the incidence of suicides, including: \u2022 That there should be a strategy for engagement with the family. \u2022 That every patient should have access to 24-hour Crisis Support Neither of these key components of care were available to Kaye. Whilst I was informed that there were steps being taken to address these I was not persuaded that these guidelines had been fully implemented.nculcated into policy and practice at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. I should be grateful if the following information be provided to me: 1. Confirm the processes that are in place to ensure that all patients who are in receipt of care by the mental health teams have a strategy for the engagement with the family and how this will be audited. It should be noted that Kaye had been under the care of the Older Adults Mental Health Services since 2017. 2. Confirm the plans for ensuring that all patients in crisis can be followed up, out of hours and at weekends by a Crisis Team or similar. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 25\/8\/2023. I, the Coroner, may extend this period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is necessary 8 COPIES AND PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and the following Interested Person (s) \u2022 The family of Kaye McCoy I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response.

The inquest heard evidence that the backlogs for therapy were such that the waiting list at the time she was assessed as being appropriate for step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the waiting period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both primary and secondary care. This was due to ashortage of trained therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not specific to the CWP trust. 2. The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelle\u2019s death recognised that the lack of ownership created through the application of its referral and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant changes had been made. However it was unclear if nationally the lesson had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar steps. 3. The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such as Michelle. In Michelle\u2019s case the BTP file reviewer (the nature of the offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and had not considered the mental health\/vulnerability of Michelle Jennings as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt 3 with by the Magistrates Court without them being given the full background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a consequence of Michelle\u2019s death taking steps to address how their prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather information where mental health is an issue. However there is no clear mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to life) in relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within the other 42 Police Forces in

is a risk of a future reoccurrence of the situation which arose on 14 June 2022 given that SECAMBS is regularly operating at Stage 4 of its Surge Management Plan, meaning that demand for the service

concerns arising out of this investigation and inquest relate to the following key areas,  a) Safeguarding b) Mental health provision c) Inter-agency communication \u2013 particularly where there is some doubt over who should provide additional support needed by a person. We heard in evidence that in the months after Lucy\u2019s death, a Safeguarding Adults Board considered the case, but did not consider that a Safeguarding Adults Review (\u2018SAR\u2019) should be undertaken. Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made. A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted. The evidence of the Assistant Director of Adult Social Care was that this is likely to be completed within 1-3 months after the inquest. I have set out the issues \/ concerns that I have for each of the two recipients of this report, below. Reading Borough Council 1) Time scales for review and triage of safeguarding referrals. 2) Requirements to speak to the individual about whom safeguarding concerns have been raised. 3) Training around Section 42 and when a report meets the threshold for neglect or abuse. This training should also consider what options are available if a concern does not meet the threshold for a Section 42 enquiry. 4) Systems for making other involved agencies aware of safeguarding referrals and concerns. 5) In relation to each of the above points, whether RBC should reflect the above changes in formal (written) policy, as well as delivering training. 6) Improving interaction amongst agencies involved, and consideration of the threshold for arranging joint meetings to discuss service users, whether they meet Section 42 thresholds or not. The evidence we heard is that this is now being actively encouraged. Should there be written guidance about this somewhat subjective issue ? 7) Whether they consider that the resourcing of this service is adequate and safe. 8) Systems for auditing, and what will happen if the auditing reveals ongoing issues. Berkshire Health Care 1) How do the changes\/proposed changes to systems (including the \u2018One Team\u2019 approach) make a difference? Specifically: a) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would not be discharged from the crisis team without additional support, as she was on 2nd February? b) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would be offered some support, whether by the crisis team or otherwise, in the situation that arose on the 15th February? 2) Do they

I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that made to the crisis line the day before his  daughter died. The East London NHS Foundation  Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks  during the conversation; did not listen to ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis. In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter\u2019s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled. The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively. I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts. \u2022 This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line. \u2022 Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz\u2019s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper. \u2022 When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance. 3 2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner\u2019s officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because told my officer about it. \u2022 I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest. \u2022 I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest. \u2022 I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month. \u2022 I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest. \u2022 I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief. \u2022 Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August. This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths.

was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that: 1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (\u201cthe unit\u201d) which was part of a secure facility of theistpital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide. 2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made. 3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit. 4. The \u201cSign in\/Sign out\u201d book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods. 5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user 5 should be permitted to leave the unit. 6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased\u2019s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident. 7. Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally. 8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing. 9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased\u2019s family once the deceased was found to be missing. 10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.

When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy,  training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality. That means more than simply a change in policy wording. 3 2. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return to the ward. I heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by the end of June 2023. The new policy will confirm that, if it is safe to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded, keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse for instructions. However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving evidence was able to set out what the staff member following should do. This appears to be a significant omission. 3. Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend, even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street following a patient about whom they are worried. I spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and I was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might not be assisted by the police. That concerned me. 4. I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the emergency services respond to calls involving concerns about mental health. I understand that it is in the process of being rolled out across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces, health providers and government. I heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health trusts. I was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so I asked the MPS what is meant to happen if an escort is following a patient who has run away and about whom the escort is worried. 4 I was told that this is primarily a health problem. It was pointed out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act. Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned patient into custody and return them to hospital. However, I heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already following a patient. I heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that would allow a ward to function without the doctors and nurses needed to undertake such a task. I heard nothing of any training given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward. From the evidence I heard, the police \/ health trust partnership working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the other\u2019s responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked ward for their own safety. Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of how to tackle these difficult situations and exactly who is meant to be doing what. 5. Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for believing immediate risk of self harm. I was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS, trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patient\u2019s risk. The police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading, but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did not ask for the trust\u2019s grading then the trust would not offer it. I was told that, until April 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to police if & when the police attended the ward. It is now filled out on a portal as part of the reporting procedure. However, it is not clear to me how far the grab pack aligns with local policies, whether all useful information (including the trust\u2019s grading of risk) is recorded as a matter of routine, and how far the police and the trust are using the same terminology with the same definitions. It seems that this would benefit from consideration. 5 6. ELFT staff all told me that, after Ms Findlay had run off, they still graded her as medium rather than high risk. She had had long term suicidal thoughts, had made previous attempts on her life and, prior to being admitted to hospital on 20 May 2020 had purchased sodium nitrate and had planned to take this to kill herself. However, she had appeared to improve in hospital, and had been granted 15 minutes\u2019 escorted leave twice a day since 1 June without incident. At one point in her evidence it appeared to me that the matron, taking the point that by running away Ms Findlay had acted in a manner that was wholly unexpected by the trust, was of the view that Ms Findlay should then have been re-categorised as high risk. However, following re-examination by counsel for ELFT the matron appeared to retract this and to return to her former position that, even after she had run away Ms Findlay was only of medium risk to herself. It is of course a matter of clinical opinion what risk grading a patient should be given, and no person can see into the future. However, \u2022 the jury found a failure by ELFT to recognise that, by 11 June 2020, Ms Findlay was at imminent risk of suicide by sodium nitrate; and \u2022 any investigation following a death like Heather Findlay\u2019s presents an opportunity for sober and searching reflection. So I am concerned that an element of positional bias may have influenced the thinking of ELFT staff. I am concerned about this particularly because, when giving evidence at inquest, the ELFT serious incident investigation author was adamant that it was only appropriate for the HCA who called the police on 11 June 2020 after Ms Findlay had run away, to tell the police of a risk of self harm not of a risk of suicide. Her rationale for this was that the last time Ms Findlay had articulated a plan to kill herself, was when she was found in hospital with a ligature round her neck on 28 May 2020. This position seems lacking the necessary reflection. 6 I draw your attention to earlier prevention of future deaths reports (PFDs) as follows: \u2022 Sent to ELFT on 8 June 2023 by Assistant Coroner Buckett following the inquest touching the death of Hilary (Billy) Guedalla, including concern regarding the failure of ELFT to inform the police of the serious suicide risk that the deceased posed to themselves; and the confusion among staff about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing. \u2022 Sent to ELFT on 25 January 2023 by me following the inquest touching the death of Andrew Largin, including concern about omissions from a serious incident investigation. \u2022 Sent to ELFT on 20 October 2021 by me following the inquest touching the death of

Brenda was discharged without any planned follow up. Her family were not.\ninvolved in the discharge process despite assurances that they would be, her GP did not receive discharge notification from the Hadrian unit until 8 days after the event or from the Crisis team until 10 days after Brenda's death. Referrals promised from Hadrian unit to Drug\/Alcohol services and Persistent Physical Symptoms Service were not made. (2) Inadequate weight seems to have been given to Brenda's alcohol problems and her assurances that all was, and would continue to be well were accepted at face value despite her recent history, her family find it hard to understand how she could be graded low risk on the day she died. (3) I refer you to the PFD report I issued referring to Charlotte Grace on 29\/10\/19. Assurances were given in response to that report which again focused on discharge without family\/carer involvement which is surely paramount. I note actions mentioned in the incident report in this case but am still concerned that similar events may occur in future. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and the wider trust have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, 9 namely by 2nd August 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons : Brenda's family and her GP of Eden Medical Group, Carlisle 8 I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest.

a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion\u2019s GP had made a \u2018very urgent\u2019 referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation (SPOAA) on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this \u2018very urgent\u2019 referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients. b. During the evidence it was accepted that \u2018a\u2019 above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board\u2019s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement. 2. An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion\u2019s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing \/ disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner. Coroner's Office, County Hall, Wynnstay Road, Ruthin, LL15 1YN | ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 3 August 2023. I, Kate Sutherland, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Family of the Deceased and to the Chief Coroner. I have also sent a copy to Eluned Morgan, Heath Minister. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 Dated 8 June 2023 Signature HM Senior

On 4 July 2022 Mr. Harper attended the Emergency Department at Gloucester Royal Hospital, and was seen by a nurse from the Mental Health Liaison team there, who recorded that he was very anxious and distressed, and voicing ongoing thoughts of suicide. The nurse felt that Mr. Harper would benefit from a period of treatment under the care of the Home Treatment Team, and because Mr. Harper was living in Worcestershire at the time, and because it was now in the early hours of the following day, he called the Worcestershire Crisis Team to arrange that. The nurse concerned was under the impression that by making this phone call, and passing on Mr. Harper's details to the Crisis Team, he was referring Mr. Harper's case to them. He told the inquest that he was expecting mental health services in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment of Mr. Harper, and he therefore ensured that Mr. Harper was told to expect the Crisis Team to contact him to arrange a further assessment. (2) The Clinical Lead for the Crisis Team in Worcestershire gave evidence to the inquest that whilst the Crisis Team did receive a request from the nurse at Gloucester that night, they interpreted it only as a request for further assessment ( but not an urgent one ), and not as a request that Mr. Harper be referred to the Home Treatment Team. (3) In the event, an urgent assessment was not arranged, and Mr. Harper's case was only considered by the Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his temporary GP in Worcestershire, out of further concern for Mr. Harper's mental health, made a new and separate referral to them. (4) I have concluded that the events described above arose out of a lack of understanding between the two NHS Trusts concerned ( Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( HWHCT ) and Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( GHCT ) ) as to how each other's mental health services are run \u00ad otherwise arrangements would have been made for Mr. Harper's mental health to be assessed urgently, as was intended. (5) If staff at HWHCT and GHCT do not understand how to make urgent mental health referrals or requests for urgent mental health assessments to each other, there remains a risk that other deaths may

his arrival at HMP Lewes on 24 March 2021, Mr Dean was offered and attempted to make his initial \u2018first night\u2019 phone call but did not manage to speak to anyone. Over the next 36 hours, he made requests of prison staff for another opportunity to make a phone call, which were refused. During the same period, his partner tried to contact the prison through the prison switchboard, but was not able to make any contact with him. In his suicide note to his partner, Mr Dean wrote \u201cI tried to get to talk to you but these lot here wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d I am concerned that there are no clearly defined processes to ensure that new prisoners can successfully make first contact with family members (when this does not take place on the first night) and for logging and handling incoming calls to the central switchboard from family members with concerns about a prisoner\u2019s safety and\/or requesting a welfare check.  Following the inquest, I gave the Ministry of Justice an opportunity to address these concerns by providing further evidence of any new procedures that have been put in place since Andrew Dean\u2019s death, but they declined to do so. In my view, these are matters that require further consideration by the Ministry of Justice and HMP Lewes to avoid a risk of future deaths through self-harm or suicide.

A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the absence of liaison between the highly specialist services of the CADAT team and the stepdown 3 services provided by NELFT. There was a lack of full information sharing around risk and joint risk assessment\/risk management planning on discharge. 2. Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatment. There was a concern that neither service adequately highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to share information with the skin clinic. The inquest heard that patients with BDD should be fully informed of the risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should be made aware of the BDD diagnosis. 3. The Inquest heard that there is a need for training to be provided to step-down service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with it. 4. The inquest heard that there is a lack of national resources for BDD. The highly specialised service at South London and Maudsley has a very long waiting list (several months). This is on a background of concerns of a likely increase in BDD.

am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team that neither team is able to access the other teams records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis - such as substance misuse and mental health - given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual. I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk

inquest highlighted the significant numbers of prisoners who enter the  prison system with known or undiagnosed mental health issues. Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable

Trust\u2019s own investigation into events leading to Mr Howe\u2019s death did not consider the full extent of his contacts with mental health services, lacked any meaningful degree of critical analysis of events, and omitted to seek to explore fundamental issues such as access to services from theist\u2019s perspective. As a consequence, it is a matter of concern that the Trust has not taken the opportunity to derive all available learning from Mr Howe\u2019s death. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10th July 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to Mr Howe\u2019s next of kin. I have also sent a copy to the Care Quality Commission and Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner.

inquest heard evidence that GMP have guidance to support officers in assessing risk and guiding actions when there is a missing person report. The evidence was that despite the existence of the policy\/document the risk was not recognised as being high risk and the appropriate actions were not taken immediately. The evidence indicated that a number of factors were key in this failure to accurately assess the risk. This included: 1. Poor understanding by GMP staff of the fact that a patient detained on a voluntary basis in a mental health ward could still be high risk if they failed to return; 2. Lack of understanding by GMP staff that the use by mental health units of short periods away from the unit to support a patient\u2019s recovery did not mean a patient could not be high risk if they did not return; 3. Lack of understanding by officers of how to apply the golden hour guidance and what was the expectation in terms of timeliness of undertaking the steps within the guidance coupled with a lack of understanding by some officers of the way\/cost to GMP in accessing mobile phone data such as cell site; and 4. Poor quality documentation and information sharing between officers and supervision in relation to information from the family and the mental health unit. The inquest was told that GMP had rolled out an Aide Memoire system to try to embed greater consistency and understanding of the policy across GMP. The Aide Memoires were recognised as being an effective tool. However, there was no evidence available to assist in understanding if the Aide Memoires were being used effectively across the force and how GMP were measuring the implementation of them. Evidence was given to the inquest that GMP have introduced further training on missing persons. However, the effectiveness of that training was unclear given witnesses who had been on the training who gave evidence remained of the view that Rebecca was not a high-risk missing person despite all

A failure to adequately assess risk of harm - Poor record keeping and a failure to read electronic records meant that important information was not considered at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (\"MDT\") ward round on 6th April 2021. The MDT arrived at a conclusion that Mr. Charles' risk of self-harm was \"no risk\". A psychologist's assessment on the clinical record that assessed Mr Charles risk of self-harm as high on 31\/3\/21 was neither read nor incorporated into the MDT discussion. 2. A decision to reduce observation frequency made by the MDT on 6\/4\/21 was not supported by the Trust Policy guidance which indicated that enhanced observations were appropriate. 3. A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed - observations between 16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles' death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator. The decision meant all patients subject to general observation on the ward were ignored. 4. Failures to respond to an emergency adequately - The Trust described the emergency response as chaotic . Staff agreed that they \"panicked\" and did not follow policy, specific issues include; a. A ward emergency bell was not sounded, b. An anti-barricade key was not used to open Mr Charles' door, instead the door was forced open causing a risk of harm to Mr Charles. C. A ligature cutter could not be used promptly as it was secured in a box with a combination lock - staff did not know the combination, d. Duty doctors were not called promptly, e. Oxygen administration was delayed, f. An on-site defibrillator was not used by staff g. Staff could or would not provide a clear and relevant history to paramedics. 5. The credibility of evidence provided by Trust staff. a. Two Trust witnesses declined to answer questions put to them regarding whether their observation records were truthful. b. Observation records appeared to have been created utilising a \"cut and 2 paste\" function. C. Records often inaccurately recorded the prescribed frequency of observation. d. Factually inaccurate entries were made in the record following Mr Charles' death. On 11th April 2021 an entry stated that Mr Charles was, \"Awake in his bedroom sitting on his bede (sic)\" at 07.21 . On 12th April two entries made at 9.48 and 11 .40 recorded that Mr Charles' was alive and well. Senior Trust witnesses characterised these entries as dishonest. 6. Governance process failings. a. A datix incident report created on the evening of 10th April 2021 by a senior nurse and Modern Matron contained misleading information that suggested that emergency response policies were followed when in fact they were not. b. The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action. C. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021. This document also failed to identify or escalate the significant issue of the suspension of observation at 16.00 on 10th April 2021 . d.

5 NHS Trusts and 3 police forces in different geographic areas had contact with Patrick in the final month of his life and each thereby gained some information about the risk to him. However, that information was by reason of the agencies falling into different geographic areas. There was no single effective global focus on Patrick's case.s for the information being acquired piecemeal about Patrick\u2019s pattern of serious self-harming behaviour. The various agencies were significantly impeded in forming a single clear picture of Patrick\u2019s pattern of behaviour (which was particularly necessary in circumstances where he was not engaging and therefore not assisting in providing a complete history himself). 2. GPs act as a repository for information about contact with other clinical agencies (such as attendances at accident and emergency departments) and therefore serve as a point of contact for information about past history. However, I heard evidence at inquest from accident and emergency consultants that it is either not possible to access information held by a GP practice out of GP surgery hours or where it is possible to do so that is only available if the GP is in the same geographic area as the accident and emergency department. Several of 3 Patrick\u2019s attendances at accident and emergency departments were out of GP surgery hours. 3. I was informed at inquest that one local authority (in whose area Patrick resided) had been made aware by police of the risk to Patrick following one of his self- harm incidents (in respect of a particularly important piece of information) and had relayed that information to a 6th NHS Trust (not one of the 5 from which I heard evidence at inquest) but Patrick did not reside in that Trust area. Those Trusts which did have direct contact with Patrick were never made aware of that piece of information nor had any means of accessing it. 4. I heard evidence that there is no national \u2018risk flagging\u2019 system: for example, when a person attends an accident and emergency department having self- harmed, the fact of a previous self-harm attendance at a different accident and emergency department is not systematically flagged up. 5. In summary, there was no single effective global focus consolidating the information which was flowing into the various agencies about Patrick; no global focus to which those agencies could in turn refer in emergency to obtain the totality of information about Patrick\u2019s recent pattern of behaviour; no national \u2018risk flagging\u2019 system to alert those agencies to his significant

]],["The Trust had a shortfall of nursing staff in the Dover and Deal area at the time that Benjamin Hart was under the community mental health team such that although 16 nurses were required to run the service, the Trust only had 8 nurses employed at the time, 2 of whom were long term sick. This left a working complement of 6 nurses to cover the whole area, which required them to take on additional duties. There was no resilience within the team and therefore when the relationship between Ben and his care coordinator broke down there was no capacity within the team to allocate him another care coordinator. Although the Trust has regrouped, reorganised and there has been some limited recruitment the shortfall endures; the evidence given at the inquest being that this is a national issue but it is

Inquest heard evidence from the Head of Service for Safeguarding and Learning for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. She highlighted a long-standing gap in provision, which was described as extending across most if not all local authorities, for vulnerable adults who have complex needs, but who do not fall into the existing framework of social services, Care Act provision or formal mental health supervision. The effect of that gap is that there is no identifiable individual who is a single point of contact in such cases equivalent to a social worker or care co-ordinator. The result is that many vulnerable adults with complex needs have no such arrangements in place for contact, collating and sharing of information and deployment of services and assistance, support or safeguarding. Where such arrangements are in place, they are necessarily ad hoc in nature in differing frameworks, levels and standards, and can devolve by default to an individual who, whilst well-motivated, may

A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singh's death across the custodial and healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by all organisations with responsibility for Mr. Singh's safety and health during his time at HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singh's family, insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT system. 2. Much of the evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated missed opportunities to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prison's inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit). The consequences of the failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health team's caseload promptly and therefore did not have the benefit of an allocated CPN and the oversight and input of a mental health multi-disciplinary team. Many steps have been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation occurring again. 3. However, there are two features of the mental health care provided to Mr. Singh that create a risk to the lives of others that have not yet been rectified: i. the fact that the mental health team multi-disciplinary team (MDT) does not include a psychiatrist; and ii. the absence of any ongoing risk assessment documentation for patients with mental illness within the SystemOne records at HMP Birmingham. 4. In Mr. Singh's case it is my conclusion that it is likely that if a psychiatrist had been at a mental health MDT meeting held on the 19th January 2022 they would have identified that he needed to be admitted to ward 2 without further delay. At the very least the need for urgent review by a psychiatrist and CPN would have been recognised and facilitated which would in turn have led to admission. CPNs in Mr. Singh's case continually failed to identify the significance of repeatedly and consistently reported psychotic symptoms and consequently he did not receive adequate assessment and treatment which increased his risk of self harm and suicide which in turn was not sufficiently identified. The absence of a psychiatrist at the MDT creates a risk that the significance of some symptoms and presentations will not be recognised and further deaths could occur due to lack of appropriate assessment and treatment. 5. Other electronic health care records systems used in mental health settings have a rolling risk assessment document that clinicians are required to review and update at certain points in a patient's management. The risk assessment document provides a prompt to clinicians to formally consider risk and come to a reasoned, documented conclusion that then feeds into decision making. The record also provides a reliable, easily accessible source of risk history. No such facility is in use on SystemOne at HMP Birmingham. Further, the evidence given was that such a system is not being used routinely across mental health care within the prison estate and is not provided as standard on SystemOne. This creates an ongoing risk to life arising from under-estimation of risk as a result of clinicians not formally considering and assessing current risk levels, and salient risk history not being easily accessible. It is understood by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust that it should be possible to create a specific risk assessment record within SystemOne and this is being considered locally.

During the 2\u00bd years in which Charlotte\u2019s mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2\u00bd years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte. I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust\u2019s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust\u2019s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust\u2019s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness\/absence. I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future. (2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte\u2019s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust\u2019s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so. I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT

a discharge plan was implemented in Ms. Findlay\u2019s case, it would appear that steps were not taken to contact her emergency contact and\/or next of kin, such as to facilitate Ms. Findlay being supported in the community upon discharge. Ms. Findlay, having discharged herself, left the hospital with next of kin\/ emergency contacts not being aware of her discharge \u2013 despite, her emergency contact being the person who had transported her to the Priory Hospital. No follow up appointment was made prior to Ms. Findlay\u2019s discharge and no attempts were made to contact her following her discharge until 6 September 2021. The matters of concern are as follows: A. That no contact was made with next of kin\/ emergency contacts prior to, or at the time of her release. B. No follow up appointment was booked prior to Ms. Findlay\u2019s discharge. C. No attempt was made to contact Ms. Findlay until 6 September 2021 (some 10 days following her discharge). 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26 April 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner. I have also sent it to \u2013 Ms. Findlay\u2019s emergency contact - who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest.

Essex Partnership NHS Foundation GTrust staff immediate emergency response was not followed: a. pinpoint alarms were not activated immediately on finding Sharon Langley unresponsive b. there was a delay calling the ambulance and basic key information about the type of the emergency was not relayed: i. by qualified nurses who made the 999 calls, or ii. to paramedics on attendance c. there was a delay informing the site co-ordinator of the emergency even though she was based on the ward and there was a lack of co- ordination of the emergency resulting in the ambulance being called a second time by the site co-ordinator d. staff trained in basic life support did not assist the two nurses who were attempting to resuscitate Sharon Langley (2) There was a difference in the safety measures fitted to the bathroom door on the adjoining Stort Ward that had a self-closure mechanism at the time of Sharon\u2019s death. This mechanism has now been fitted to Chelmer Ward. There is a concern that safety information is not shared 3 across the Trust and known risks are not mitigated appropriately. (3) The Trust was on notice of issues on Chelmer ward with doors to high- risk areas not closing that included the Staff Room and Patient Storeroom. a. At the time of Sharon\u2019s death, the mitigation on the ward was for staff to push doors to see if they were locked, this was action even though evidence was heard that these doors had keylocks and staff had keys that could have been used. b. The Patient Storeroom contains items removed from patients as they pose a significant self-harm risk and\/or suicide. c. Staff Room that contains items that pose a risk to patients Self-closure mechanisms have not been fitted to these doors in a high- risk environment of a secure psychiatric ward even though the risk is known. Evidence was heard from patient safety that it is sufficient to have maintenance manually adjust doors if there are closure issues. (4) Chelmer Ward staff did not always report door closure issues either on the ward to the Nurse in Charge or to maintenance. Following the death of Sharon Langley there has been no training on how to report door closure issues reported. (5) Evidence was heard that the bath plug was required to be kept in the ward office when not in use as the bathroom was a high-risk area. There was no evidence that staff had to obtain this from the office on the day Sharon Langley died. There still appears to be confusion around the requirement. (6) There is concern about the reliability of the Trust investigation and how the Trust learns lessons. The investigation report did not: a. scrutinise the movements of staff even though the door logs were available or raise any issues for further investigation b. raise any issues around the bath plug or where it should be kept c. investigate concerns raised around the Trust staff emergency response or failure to provide basic information on the incident to paramedics (7) The Trust investigation author changed the conclusion of his report during the inquest when he received statements provided by staff that were not requested and contained timing information that in evidence 4 staff stated they did not know. (8) Quality of record keeping was not deemed to be appropriate by senior staff during evidence: a. Significant examples of cut and paste including out-of-date risk information at all grades of ward staff, and b. omissions in multi-disciplinary decision-making and risk of self-harm with no rationale

It was clear that crucial information (that Anthony had a rope in his possession, and a collapsible bicycle providing a secondary form of transport) was not passed between the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary. It was heard that there was no set format, or prescribed information requirements to be shared by officers reporting missing persons between one force and another. Investigating officers in the Metropolitan police spoke to the Suffolk Constabulary control room, whose staff logged what they were told onto the CAD record.

I am concerned that, as there is no standardised information sharing requirements or protocols in such cases, in the future a force receiving details of a suicidal missing person may also not be informed that an individual has taken a means of suicide with them. In addition, other important information that may assist in the search for that person may also not be

During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance \u201cAutistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management.\u201d Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that \u201cLocal autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis).\u201d Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker. 2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefan\u2019s death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroner\u2019s and Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths. 3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers\/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and\/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and\/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one . 4. In the evidence provided it was outlined that \u201cKeyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time. They will make sure that local systems are responsive to fully meeting the young people\u2019s needs in a joined-up way and that whenever it is possible to provide care and treatment in the community with the right support this becomes the norm.\u201d If every autistic child or young person had a key worker this would enable them or their family the opportunity to liaise with their key worker rather than having to try to navigate services themselves.

Continued staffing pressures within Primary Mental Low Health Services resulting in assessment delays and waiting lists for support e.g the waiting list for LPMHSS counseling remains at 4 \u2013 6 months. There was no evidence that the waiting list would improve moving forward (2) Whilst awaiting counselling, the only interim support available to patients that are assessed as mild or low risk, are services that come with a requirement to self-refer, despite lack of motivation being a common symptom.

Commission for Human Medicine (CHM) established an Isotretinoin Expert Working Group (IEWG) in response to concerns about psychiatric events. The IEWG considered oral and written evidence over 2020 and 2021. The findings and recommendations of the IEWG were presented in a report to the CHM at the end of 2021 and include a recommendation which relates to prescribing for I patients under the age of 18. It is now over a year since the IEWG report was completed and the recommendations have still not been implemented.

Whilst each individual pharmacy had in-house safety checks to safeguard against over-prescribing by their own pharmacy, there is no integrated system in place which would alert a prescriber to prescriptions that have been dispensed by other on-line pharmacies. As a result, it is currently possible for a patient to obtain excessive quantities of medication by simply placing multiple orders with different on-line pharmacists. (2) There is no requirement for the on-line pharmacies to share information with the patients GP. This means that, in the absence of the patient\u2019s consent to share information, the online prescriber is reliant on the accuracy and truthfulness of the history provided by the patient. (3) Lack of information sharing also creates a risk that a GP or Pharmacist Prescriber may unwittingly prescribe a medication that is contraindicated with a medication that has been dispensed through an on-line pharmacy. The MATTERS OF CONCERN in relation to the provision of mental health care on Griffin Ward are as follows:- (1) The Recovery & Discharge Plans contained inaccurate information regarding Ania\u2019s consent to share information with her mother. The evidence was that this was an entry made in error in June 2020 and was not picked up by any of the nurses who updated the Recovery & Discharge Plan over the subsequent 11 months. (2) The Recovery & Discharge Plans did not address the risks associated with Ania\u2019s procurement of Prbpranolol from on-line pharmacies. The evidence was that an update of the Recovery & Discharge Plan involved members of nursing staff simply adding a note that the overdoses had taken place. The Plan did not show that any meaningful thought had been given to addressing the particular risk associated with the procurement of on-line medication. (3) Mandatory refresher training on basic aspects of nursing care such as record keeping, searches, care-planning, undertaking pre- and post-leave assessments and confidentiality is not provided to staff. L (4) There is no requirement for the outcome of negative personal searches to be documented in the records and consequently there is no ability to effectively audit whether searches are taking place and the treating team are unable to assess a patient\u2019s level of compliance with rules around bringing contraband items onto the ward. (5) Searches undertaken of Ania\u2019s room following the overdoses on 10 March and 5 June 2021 were ineffective and did not uncover the Propranolol that Ania had been stockpiling. (6) Documentation on which 1:5 observations are recorded does not evidence that a check has taken place every 5 minutes. Instead the current documentation, simply requires one signature per hour. There is therefore no mechanism by which observations can be effectively audited. (7) There is no requirement to make a separate entry evidencing that a post-leave assessment has been undertaking.

Emergency Response I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the  alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency. At the time of Samantha\u2019s death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward. Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patient\u2019s side. However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patient\u2019s side. I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating. To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients\u2019 side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths. The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient. 2. Observation Policy At the time of Samantha\u2019s death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samantha\u2019s death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing. Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient. Inmind Healthcare Group\u2019s new observation Policy states: \u2018Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice\u2026\u2026. Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us\u2019. Since Samantha\u2019s death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy  and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour). Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice. However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording. This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they

The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February. 2. The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team. 3. However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision. 4. The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her. 5. He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team member\u2019s manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largin\u2019s death, so between 3 and 6 February 2022. When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 2022. 3 6. It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largin\u2019s death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largin\u2019s medical record. 7. Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision maker\u2019s thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers. 8. The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct. 9. Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted.

Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life. The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant. Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key. Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error following a Chronicle systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury card to the reader and entered his PIN. It failed. reasonably thought it was because Chronicle had failed again and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had any other officer at base known that Sean\u2019s access had been restricted she would not, I am certain, have allowed him entry. There was a serious failure by senior management to effectively and safely manage the South Base Armoury. All the base officers who gave evidence before me told me the armoury system, which they referred to as Chronicle, repeatedly and randomly failed. These multiple failures were, according to not communicated effectively to her. She agreed that she did not herself make any further detailed enquiry instead relying on her Operational Inspector to manage the issue and\/or to feed back as appropriate. The computerised system controlling the access to the armoury at South Base included a  number of different parts including the server, the software, the Chronicle system itself, the card readers etc. The system as a whole repeatedly failed. There was no effective ongoing monitoring of the system. CI Rowley Smith agreed that the system did not work properly and the monitoring system did not work properly. As part of a fail safe to ensure that officers who needed weapons could obtain them if the computerised system failed, an armoury override key was kept in a locked box, secured by a PIN, in the equipment room. All officers giving evidence before me agreed that the PIN number was common knowledge. The fact that the PIN number was common knowledge meant potentially that any one of the officers working at the base had unfettered access to the armoury The fact that the access was not abused by the officers was due wholly to their trustworthiness and professionalism. On this occasion, Sean sought access to the armoury via the key but was thwarted by both PC being present in the equipment room. Unfettered access to the armoury meant that rogue officers (of whom luckily there were none) could potentially have had access to weapons for the purposes of criminality, suicide (as in Sean\u2019s case) or homicide. Overall, I find the lax approach to safety and security in the South Base armoury by senior management, who were responsible, to be extraordinary. agreed that the armoury was an unsafe environment. In the interval between Sean's death and the Inquest some 18 months later, I was not reassured that effective action had been taken to secure the armoury.

Lucy Amanda Jones was admitted to Talygarn Ward at The County Hospital Pontypool in December 2019 under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act.

In evidence provided by her General Practitioner, I was informed that Lucy was still waiting for CBT at the time of her death in March 2022. 2.

his arrival in SACU at 18.37 on 10 July 2020 and his being discovered self suspended with a ligature at 17.45 on 11 July 2020 there, Michael was subject to a 3 man unlock. On the morning of 11 July, a Saturday, there were 3 officers on duty on SACU. This did permit his cell to be unlocked for a meal to be delivered and for a cursory one and a half minute conversation with a nurse that fell short, on her evidence, of an actual medical examination. On the afternoon of 11 July there were only one or (briefly) two officers on SACU duty per the staff duty log, albeit, as CCTV footage shows, more officers did attend intermittently for specific tasks. The SACU staff duty log shows only one officer on duty for the whole afternoon to 17.00. In any event medical assessments of Michael were not undertaken at any stage while he was on SACU, the reason being given that he was on three man unlock. It appears that there were never sufficient staff available for a dedicated medical assessment to be undertaken. This notwithstanding that evidence from prison officers and a nurse was that during the course of the afternoon Michale`s presentation had become \u201cangrier\u201d and \u201cbizarre\u201d. In fact, it is now known, he had been ingesting toxic amounts , an unlicensed drug, he had secreted into the prison (his being detected at reception as plugged led him to SACU). is a highly potent which effects judgement and lowers inhibitions. The jury subsequently concluded that the absence of medical, and mental health, assessments, and the use of the (which was never diagnosed), contributed to the Michael`s death. From 17.00, when patrol state commenced, there was clearly only one officer on duty and present. When she discovered Michael self suspended that officer made a perfectly defensible dynamic assessment, electing not to enter the cell unsupported. She made ready to enter for when back up arrived. In the event, partly because there was another discipline incident unfolding on a different wing, this took 2-3 minutes. There were only 16 prison officers available while on patrol state across the entire prison, and they were already at full stretch, and probably beyond it (the Tactical Resources Unit from Doncaster were en route). The evidence was that without knowing precisely when Michael self-suspended any such delay could not be held, on a balance of probabilities, to have entered the chain of causation death. However, the fact remains that there was a delay consequent to Michael being on a three man unlock but there being only a single officer available on SACU while in patrol state. It is reasonable to conjecture that this could have made the difference between life and death in this case, and the repetition of these circumstances could well do so in future. In your response dated 15 November 2021 to the Regulation 28 report of HM Assistant Coroner James Thompson of 21 September 2021 following the Inquest into the death of Charlie Brian Todd at HMP Durham, you wrote, amongst other things: \u201cThere is clear management oversight of the SACU\u201d. This is not what the evidence in the instance case showed. Rather, what it made clear was that: 1) the SACU staff log plus CCTV further demonstrated that HMAC Thompson`s point to you  that \u201cofficers, including officers not posted to SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various task between themselves on an ad-hoc basis\u201d was an ongoing problem, and this appears to be still ongoing; 2) NOMIS record keeping was unhelpfully sparse (\u201cyou would expect more\u201d was the evidence of SACU manager); 3) the daily log was under-utilised as a multi-disciplinary tool, and this appears to be ongoing. You also stated: \u201cI am confident that the staffing levels and supervisory arrangements in place are sufficient to deliver all of the SACU`s regime\u201d. This, too, is clearly not the case. Staffing levels remain the same. Safeguarding of prisoners is compromised as a consequence. With a three man unlock imposed, there should be three officers available at all times to ensure safety.

On 13\/07\/22 Dr Ellson's GP needed to arrange an urgent mental health review as Dr Ellson had presented with suicidal ideation. The GP had significant difficulties trying to contact the Mental health team with messages giving incorrect numbers. My concern is that the system for GPs to contact mental health teams for urgent reviews is not clear nor safe. 2. Once contact had been made and a request was made for Dr Ellson to be assessed by the mental health team, the system in place is for the patient to call the mental health practitioner. My concern is that the patient is likely to be in crisis, which is why a referral is being made, and the burden should not be put on them to make the call. 3. The GP caring for Dr Ellson on 13\/07\/22 was unaware that she could make a request for a psychiatric review of the patient. The inquest heard how this was not well known by local GPs.

Inadequate Police training on Mental Health During the course of the Inquest officers involved in dealing with Jade (and in particular around the exercise of their Section 136 powers on 21\/5\/20) acknowledged that they had received very little mental health training. Some officers could not recall any additional training provided. since their initial training when they first joined the force. The officers admitted that although they were aware of the Sussex Police mental health guide they had not read it in full. The expert police witness, , told the Inquest that in his view the online training provision that we were told was being rolled out in Sussex was not sufficient. None of the officers involved in this case had yet undertaken this online training. It was his opinion that officers should be provided with the nationally recognised two day training course written by the College of Policing, The course is available for all Police forces to be rolled out locally. This training had not been adopted by Sussex Police. There was also confusion amongst Officers (and a lack of clear understanding) around the provision and use of service the Haven at Millview could provide. 2. REBOOT - Lack of provision to for older age group There was clear evidence that Jade was vulnerable and had become involved in violence and crime in 2019 (the year before his death). It was believed by some that Jade exploited by gangs running county line drug operations. A need for an early intervention was identified by his social worker and a referral to Reboot was made. The Inquest was told that at the time REBOOT was prioritising 12 \u2013 14 years children and as Jade was nearing 18 they were unable to work with him. This was a missed opportunity for Jade to be involved in a form of early intervention before his life started unravelling and he became more heavily entrenched in the world of crime.

HMP Wealstun does not have nurses or other healthcare staff in the prison during the night. (2) The incidence of self-harm incidents amongst prisoners (both in 2019 and today) make such emergencies foreseeable. (3) In the absence of healthcare staff being immediately available, the night patrol staff should be trained to respond effectively to ligature or other self-harm incidents. (4) The OSG officer who encountered the situation involving Mr Johnson around 04:45 hours had not been trained to carry out CPR. (5) The officer acting as attended the cell but did not think about CPR, believing Mr Johnson to be already dead (notwithstanding that none of the discipline officers present had anv medical qualifications to certifv death). He 6 7 8 had undertaken defibrillator training \"many years ago\". (6) The four prison officers present in the cell did not discuss the need for CPR. The possibility of using a defibrillator was not mentioned. Mr Johnson was left in the cell in a seated position without the wisdom of placing him in the recovery position being considered. (7) The medical evidence available at the Inquest indicated \"Effective CPR more than doubles the chance of someone surviving a cardiac arrest\". Furthermore, the Resuscitation Council UK advises \"provide chest compressions as soon as possible after cardiac arrest is confirmed\". (8) The value of all night patrol staff (particularly in a prison without 24 hour healthcare provision) being trained to provide effective CPR and use a defibrillator competently was recognised at the inquest, along with the wisdom of this being refreshed annually. (9) The inquest noted that there is currently no express direction in PSI 03\/2013 or other instruction to carry out CPR pending the arrival of paramedics or other qualified medical professional, when a prisoner is found in an unresponsive condition following a ligature incident. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action.

concerns relate to the bridge, which carries a road and two footpaths up to around 30m (100ft) above the reiver Weir (1) the bridge\u2019s parapet and railing is accessible to pedestrians on the bridge; (3) there is absence of monitored CCTV and lighting or other means of detecting those at immediate risk; and 2 (4) there is a risk of death to persons falling AND to those near the foot of the bridge at any time when persons fall.

The funding of the foam2023 force is insufficient to allow it to meet the increase in demand that occurs every summer when tourists come to Devon & Cornwall. I have written separately to the Home Secretary in this regard and a copy of my letter is enclosed for your information. is required from you. ii. a) Staffing levels in the CMCUs (both call handlers and Resource Deployment Officers) in Plymouth and Exeter are insufficient for the workloads experienced. b) There are an inadequate number of uniformed Officers available to respond in a timely fashion to the demand seen over the summer months. Let me acknowledge that I recognise these two issues are intertwined. The amount of budget the force receives will dictate what it can afford in terms of police staff and police officers. As Chief Inspector accepted during the course of this inquest, the police did the best they could with what they had; they simply did not have enough. My concern in relation to the CMCUs is that this problem has existed \u2013 on the evidence I heard at inquest \u2013 for a decade or so, and it is unresolved today. Indeed, I am bound to note the recent decision of HMICFRS to move the force into an enhanced level of monitoring with one of the stipulated grounds being: \u2018the force does not answer, or respond to, emergency or non-emergency calls within adequate timeframes, and too many calls are abandoned\u2026\u2019 The jury heard from Chief Supt and ACC Leaper at inquest. They were told that staffing levels for both call handlers and RDOs were still not at the \u2018design\u2019 brief advised by BT but that recruitment processes were in hand which, it was hoped, would achieve this. They were told that three separate pieces of software were to be introduced in the New Year which, once fully operational, ought to permit greater efficiencies and speedier call management. In writing to you, I wanted to bring these matters to your attention so that you can ensure the intended improvements are realised. I understand once you start in your new role you will require a little time to bring yourself up to speed with what will inevitably be a raft of pressing issues, that budgets for 2022\/3 are yet to be finalised and, finally, that the recruitment drive and IT upgrades still need to be completed.

I heard evidence students have a higher incidence of mental health difficulties, self-harm and suicide exacerbated by multifactorial issues such as being effectively itinerant with work and other social pressures. 2. Sarah was known to have significant mental health difficulties exacerbated by a recent bereavement and other personal difficulties. On 19th November 2019 after Sarah hung up on the administrator and was knowingly extremely distressed, CWB staff did not take steps to reassure themselves that Sarah was safe from self-harm. 3. The organisation and systems at the CWB were insufficiently robust to appropriately manage, treat and safeguard students known to have mental health problems and be at high risk to themselves on a background of a lack of national guidance of what are the basic requirements for universities to provide such services. 4. National guidance issued in September 2018 to reduce the incidence of suicide in the student population had not been implemented by CWB at the time of Sarah\u2019s death. 5. There was no internal (by CWB) or external regulatory (by US) oversight as to the service provision at CWB before Sarah\u2019s death or indeed after her death. 6. There was little communication or learning between and a lack of involvement sought or offered by local NHS mental health services to ensure the service provided by CWB was within an acceptable standard. 7. There was no serious incident report completed by US as to the working practices of the CWB and no reflection has taken place and no steps have been taken to put into place by CWB to provide more

has been received that Philip Battle self-referred to the ambulance service stating he had taken and overdose and that he had tried to hang himself. The then triage system (medical priority dispatch) concentrated on questions relating to physical notifiesogical function rather than assessing the actual presenting risks from poor mental health including self-inflicted fatal harm. Mr Battle lived in warden monitored sheltered accommodation and no inquiry was made about whether someone could be telephoned to check on his safety. Even if Mr Battle had not been in sheltered accommodation, it was unclear as to why there was no triage question about a phone number for a friend or relative. Evidence was given that NWAS work with Lancashire police and the health service  in Blackpool with the Synergy project sharing the resources of a triage mental health car. These arrangements and relationships do not exist in Liverpool. The Court was concerned about silo - public health working between Blue light services - given the limited mental health intervention resource for NWAS was not on duty on the morning of 8th July and there was no call to Merseyside Police to see if its Mental Health triage car was available to intervene. Evidence was heard that these services need commissioning and there was no arrangement between Merseyside Police and the NWAS to share mental health intervention resources. This issue appears to become more important when the court heard of the plans for three mental health ambulances to be available in Merseyside and Cheshire in the near future. The Court would like the ambulance service, Police and health providers to work together with the public funds at their respective disposal to develop in concert and to share community mental health

the course of the inquest, evidence was heard from a Detective Inspector with North Yorkshire Police who is a Firearms Licensing Manager. The evidence was that, unlike standard police prosecutions, prosecutions of individuals by other authorities do not involve automatic checks of the Police National Computer which would flag whether that individual is licensed to possess a firearm. The appearance of such an alert allows the firearms licensing authority to assess the individual\u2019s continuing suitability to possess a firearm in the context of the prosecution and its possible outcomes. In this instance, the deceased was being prosecuted for tax fraud by HMRC and was due to make a court appearance on the day of his death. He left a note of intent, indicating that the prosecution and its likely outcome were central to his decision to end his life. Had it been flagged that the deceased was facing such a prosecution, I was informed that it was Regulation 28 \u2013 After Inquest OFFICIAL Document Template Updated 30\/07\/2021 'highly likely' that his access to licensed firearms would have been restricted and the weapons removed from him in accordance with statutory guidance. While it cannot be said that this would have prevented the deceased's death by his own hand from some other means, it would have prevented the unlawful discharge of the weapon as a means of suicide. I understand that this issue has been escalated to the NPCC Lead for firearms licensing with a view to highlighting the concern with all non-police prosecuting authorities. I also understand that the HMRC investigator did not respond to the officer's contact with the agency to flag this issue.

While acknowledging Daniel\u2019s high level of contact with the IHBTT team, the evidence was that no one was taking responsibility for his care in a \u2018key worker\u2019 type role. The large number of people seeing Daniel did not make deep professional relationships with him which would allow his needs and risks to be addressed in a person centred and properly risk sensitive way. The relationships with Daniel were superficial and this infected the risk assessment process. The large number of mental health professionals in contact with Daniel inhibited him establishing deep relationships of trust. 5.2 The risk assessments themselves were therefore superficial, often relying uncritically on self-reporting without meaningfully engaging in suicide risk prevention. The initial risk assessment on first contact on 16.07.21 was flawed in that, despite the presenting context being an attempt at suicide by hanging, the risk assessment was \u2018low risk of suicide\u2019. 5.3 Daniel was a serving soldier and there was a failure to meaningfully communicate and engage with his Regiment and the medical staff attached to it. 5.4 Communication with the family was superficial and the evidence was that their perception was that they couldn\u2019t fully share issues and concerns because of perceived barriers in information sharing. This may not have been the team\u2019s intention, but it was the reality felt by the family. This inhibited their engagement with the team in Daniel\u2019s best interests. The evidence of was that engagement with the family was important because they were the people who knew Daniel best and who would be the first to identify any risks or concerns. 5.5 There was evidence that staff in the team struggled with decision making around information sharing. For example, on 15.09.21, the day before he died, Daniel\u2019s girlfriend called to share concerns about his wellbeing. The person taking the call indicated that Daniel\u2019s lack of knowledge of her referral placed the team in difficulty in sharing the information. In the event, a practitioner saw Daniel for a visit only a few minutes later and correctly identified his need for an urgent psychiatric review. Notwithstanding this, I considered that this was evidence of a failure to understand the basics of risk-based information sharing. 5.6 In summary, therefore, I considered that there was evidence that a failure to address these issues could create a risk of further deaths: \u2022 Superficiality of risk assessments \u2022 Lack of a key worker approach \u2022 Lack of communication with the armed

Training The evidence that indicated an absence of mandatory training for academic staff on suicide prevention and mental health awareness. The University is invited to review the provision of training for academic staff upon information sharing [see below], mental health awareness and suicide prevention. 2) Responding proactively The evidence indicated that nobody from the university attempted to speak to or visit Harry despite numerous concerns being raised regarding his wellbeing. There was a total absence of personal engagement. The court heard that research has consistently shown that most students and staff who experience poor mental health do not access formal support. The university response was entirely by email and can be characterized as reactive. The evidence indicated a marked reluctance to respond flexibly and proactively to concerns. The university is invited to review their policy as regards their response to welfare concerns and whether the current approach is sufficiently flexible and proactive. Specifically, whether there is an over-reliance on email responses and students themselves completing online application forms to access support. 3) Sharing information The university policy allows sharing of information with consent in circumstances involving a concern for wellbeing, and without consent in exceptional circumstances. This necessarily would have involved a conversation with Harry and failing that a consideration whether exceptional circumstances applied for sharing information with his parents. The evidence revealed a lack of staff awareness regarding university policy on information sharing. There was evidence of a misunderstanding of policy which specifically allowed the sharing of information in cases of concern, subject to discussion with Harry, and then in exceptional circumstances Information Classification: PUBLIC without his consent. Witnesses referred to a blanket ban on sharing or alternatively to sharing only if they perceived imminent risk to life. The evidence indicated that there was insufficient consideration given to notifying Harry\u2019s parents of the extent of his exam failure, in order to fully mobilize Harry\u2019s support network. There was no evidence of the \u2018Think Family\u2019 approach adopted by the university following previous suicides. The University is invited to review the thresholds for sharing information and staff awareness of those thresholds, and the implementation and understanding across academic and welfare staff of the Think Family approach. 4) Pastoral support The evidence indicated that if Harry\u2019s pastoral tutor had known Harry\u2019s mobile number, he may have called him. The court heard that there was no policy for pastoral tutors exchanging mobile numbers with students. The university is invited to review whether pastoral tutors should offer to exchange mobile numbers with their students, and to consider whether pastoral tutors should have a work mobile to facilitate a proactive approach in the event that there are concerns for wellbeing. 5) Welfare services case management system The court heard evidence that systems failures led to safeguarding alerts not being followed up and the case marked closed. The university is invited to review whether the welfare case management system is fit for purpose, whether it is sufficient to capture and ensure actions on welfare concerns raised by students or

The is a need for the  recognition of the link between domestic abuse and suicide. Processes and policies do not seem to include this serious area to the extent that is required. (2) There is no system to appropriately identify and care for the vulnerable who do not meet the criteria of \u201chigh risk\u201d which is covered by MARAC, evidence was heard that a large number of domestic homicide reviews cover victims who have not been rated as \u201chigh risk\u201d (3) There was a lack of information sharing between all agencies, even those tasked with domestic abuse. a. There is no one database which is accessible for all agencies to input their common concerns. b. There is lack of robust policy of information sharing regarding both suicidal ideation, self harm as well as identification of the vulnerable. It is noted that the Health and Care Act is due to commence on 1st July 2022, which outlines need for interagency working. This may be an ideal opportunity to address these issues. (4) There is no single point of contact to oversee the collation of all 3 information, to appropriate assess it and to coordinate a structured proactive approach to people with dual or multi diagnosis. This is in both MARAC and for those who are vulnerable but do not meet the \u201chigh risk\u201d criteria. (5) There is a need to consider better training and awareness of both domestic abuse and risk of suicide for front line police officers. (6) Consideration to be given to whether the deployment of front line officers to deal with domestic abuse is appropriate, and whether this should be referred to police adult safeguarding in the same way that criminal investigations are often elevated to CID. (7) Evidence was heard that the DASH form may benefit from updating. (8) The processes of Humber police\u2019s vulnerability hub and DARA forms which show a more proactive, collative approach, are not currently a nationally recognised method of working. (9) If not already in place, to consider complex case forums on a national level. (10)Consideration as to whether GP\u2019s and other voluntary organisations\/non-statutory organisations should be invited to MARAC (11) To consider better information sharing about the risks of sleep deprivation and its impact on mental health and suicide. (12) I was requested to consider placing MARAC on a statutory footing in line with an earlier RPFD , I merely highlight this report \u2013 2019 Andrew Harris, Senior Coroner for Inner North London in

MrWaddup was referred to mental health on 29th October2019 on triaged within 24 hours on 30th October 2019. Attempts were made to assess him bv teleohone on 14, 19 and 21 November 2019. It is not clear if Mr Wadduo personally knew of the appointments. Appointment letters are currently not sent to inmates at HMP Northumberland to notify them of planned appointments. Prisoners could be notified on the day via the appointment scheduling process within the prison whereby the wing is notified of who has appointments with various departments. I heard that TEWV provide mental health services across the North East cluster of prisons including four prisons in the North West. In some custodial facilities an appointment letter is sent. This system is not replicated in HMP Northumberland (2) Mr Waddup was referred to mental health on 30 October 2019. Attempts were made to assess him in his cell over the telephone on 14, 19 and 21 November 2019. He was discharged from mental health on 2 December 2019 without an assessment being undertaken. There was no in person contact to explore the reasons he did not attend those appointments prior to discharge. It could not be confirmed he was personally aware of those appointments. He self-referred on 5 December 2019 and was not triaged within 24 hours or assessed prior to his death. An immediate review of the Did Not Attend (DNA) policy for the mental health services to include an in person contact is being undertaken prior to discharge but has not been completed. (3) Mr Waddup self-referred via the kiosk system. There is no triaging of referrals on a weekend.

In June 2020 the Independent Office for Police Complaints recommended that all response vehicles be equipped with a ligature cutter or similar. That recommendation was accepted by Chief Superintendent Clare Evans on behalf of South\nWales Police in July 2020. I received evidence from Chief Inspector that in 2020 South Wales Police had determined to widen the scope of the recommendation to all frontline officers. She informed me that ligature cutters were delivered to the force in July 2022. As at the 4th of October 2022, approximately 25% of those had been distributed to frontline officers. Coroner\u2019s Office, The Old Courthouse, Courthouse Street, Pontypridd, CF37 1JW She was unable to assist the court with the timeline for the remaining distribution other than in relation to her own force division - a target date of the 22nd of October 2022. She candidly accepted in her evidence that the incomplete distribution to all frontline officers at this time meant that the scenario faced by the response officers attending upon Mr White on the 20th of October 2019 was still patent & the opportunity to release a suspended individual currently dependent upon whether there had been distribution to the tasked response officers. That is the concern that I have and wish you to consider and address. 2. A collateral concern, not directly causative of Mr White\u2019s death, arose during the inquest and which I also wish to bring to your attention. This concerns the availability of bespoke training to response officers in relation to handling similar situations faced by the officers on the 20th of October 2019. The three attending officers on 20.10.19 indicated that they had not received specific training (notwithstanding the evidence I received from retired Detective Chief inspector that he had prepared a video for officers covering this type of scenario as part of mental health awareness training in 2017) to assist them in managing the scenario they faced. Retired Detective Chief Inspector indicated that he had delivered training that year to officers within the force for the purposes of cascading the same widely. Given both the statistical and anecdotally evidenced increase in mental health crisis incidents (on occasions resulting in death) that your officers are required to attend, I believe that it would be of benefit to those officers who have not received this bespoke training, (as well, perhaps those who may benefit from refreshing their knowledge) for consideration to be given to reinstating the same and expediting its delivery widely \u2013 i.e. to all frontline staff. I would stress that the two immediate response officers cannot be, nor indeed were, criticised in their individual interactions with Mr White on the 20th of October 2019.

On completion of the inquest, I found the decision to rescind detention under s.2 on 25\/3\/19 was undermined in two essential respects: a) A failure to update a suicide self-harm risk assessment. b) A failure to formulate a Care and Treatment plan identifying core treatment needs. 2) A Serious Incident Investigation (SII), commissioned by CNWL, completed on 9\/9\/2019, investigated the Risk Assessment element and made recommendations which I heard from a CNWL witness had subsequently been implemented and I am satisfied that this risk to life has been satisfactorily reduced. However, I remain concerned that the Care and Treatment plan aspect was not identified by the SII and as such no recommendations were identified and followed up. The psychiatrist who rescinded s.2, on 25\/3\/2019, was unable to participate in the inquest through illness. As a result, I instructed an independent expert psychiatrist who gave evidence that there had been no treatment plan addressing Daniel\u2019s core treatment needs. The core treatment needs were that Daniel required antipsychotic medication to control his delusional beliefs and psychological intervention to address his substance misuse which exacerbated his delusional beliefs. The expert also identified from statements and medical records that Daniel lacked insight into his mental health conditions and thereby lacked capacity. The treatment Daniel required was twofold. Assertive treatment of the delusional disorder with antipsychotics, whilst detained under s.2, to achieve stability, coupled with psychological therapy to address the illicit drug use. I heard evidence that antipsychotics could not commence until the results of liver function tests were available, but this did not persuade the expert, that recission of s.2 was correct. The psychiatrist who rescinded s.2 on 25\/3\/19 was interviewed by the SII but the care and treatment plan aspect was not explored by that investigation. My concern is that failures in the formulation of a Care and Treatment Plan made a significant contribution to the death and this failing was not exposed until the inquest when it could have been identified much earlier by the SII in September 2019. The fact that a Care and Treatment plan was not formulated gives me concern that the mistake could be repeated in future and my concern is compounded by the SII failing to investigate and make recommendations arising from this issue. Accordingly, I am reporting this matter to the Minister for Health and CNWL Trust to make such recommendations as they see fit arising from the expert evidence uncovered by the inquest so that any necessary lessons can be learned. 2) My second concern is the poor contemporaneous documentation of the grant of unescorted leave from the hospital and the time taken to alert the police when Daniel failed to return on 26\/3\/19 by 21:00 pm. A ward nurse eventually contacted the police after midnight. i) I am concerned that an earlier call to the police may have prevented the death, because Daniel was recorded on General Security Zone (GSZ) cameras at 22:21 leaving Vauxhall bridge, and returning, on foot at 23:48. An earlier call might have enabled police to intervene before he was able to commence the actions which ended his life. ii) The ward manager claimed in evidence that he had instructed others to call the police when Daniel failed to return at 21:00. However, this was not documented anywhere in the medical records and a leave book with handwritten entries went missing after the death. The missing leave book was not investigated by the SII. 3 iii) A nurse who called the police, sometime before 00:30 according to the medical records, or at 01:10 according to police records, was not interviewed by the SII. I found these investigative deficits troubling because the learning of lessons in patient care depends, in part, on an early SII by the hospital concerned so that risks to patient safety can be identified to enable recommendations and improvements long before an inquest conclusion. The delay in reporting the failure to return to the Ward was a factor that contributed to the dangerous situation already created by rescinding s.2. I am nonetheless concerned that, in general, psychiatric patients being tested on voluntary leave are a vulnerable group and as such failures to return should be reported with expedition not only because they may be a danger to themselves, but also due to a risk of being preyed upon by others.

During the course of the inquest, it was a concern to me the increase in the number of children and young people who are now being seen with regard to their emotional well- being, psychological distress and mental\nhealth difficulties which have impacted on them requiring support and assessment since the Coronavirus pandemic and the delays that now exist before they receive treatment and support. (2) I heard that in 2020 if the criteria for referral had been met for referral to Children's Adolescent Mental Health Services there would have been a triage of the child or young person within 8 weeks, treatment within up to 19 weeks with the number of referrals at that time being 1,595. In 2022, subject to meeting the criteria for referral, there would be a triage of the child or young person within 3 weeks but that the waiting time for treatment has increased from up to 19 weeks to up to 63 weeks with the number of referrals being 2,275. (3) I heard evidence from Cramlington Learning Village where Charley was a pupil and they told me since Charley's death they have strengthened their support for children suffering from anxiety and other mental health issues by increasing the mental health learn, employing two emotional literacy teaching assistants, a Mental Health and Well Being Practitioner, another Thrive Practitioner and increased the number of Deputy Safeguarding Leads to 5. (4) I heard from a Paediatric Nurse Practitioner who is based in the Accident and Emergency at Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital, Cramlington who told me in evidence that in 2020 it was the case that she would see a referral from a child or young person struggling with emotional distress, anxiety, mental health difficulties and instances of self-harm and overdose once a week but that since the Coronavirus pandemic the incidence of assessments for children and young people with those issues has risen from once per week to once per shift. I also heard from the Group Nurse Director forCumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust in the North Locality who told me that in May 2020 she would see 100 referrals a month from children experiencing anxiety and mental health difficulties but in May 2022 the number of referrals has increased to 300 children per month. The reason for the referrals is complex but includes the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic with staff seeing an increase in demand in the numbers of young people suffering with anxiety, low self-esteem, bod image, OCD and instances of self-harm and overdose. (5) I ask for there to be an assessment of the services and resources that can be offered to meet the increase in demand in the number of children and young people seeking support with regard to their emotional well-being, psychological distress and mental health difficulties which have impacted on them since the Coronavirus pandemic and to reduce the delay in receiving early support in order to

At the incident location there is little if anything by way of safety measures that would prevent anyone from being able to climb over, around or on top of the side railings of the bridge or to prevent them from jumping from the bridge to the carriageway. There is for example no enclosure of the walkway to prevent this. 2. At the incident location there are no means of summonsing help or calling for help should a person be in crisis and require assistance. There are no signs or signposting for mental health assistance or support (such as from Samaritans). 3. There are no known monitored CCTV cameras covering the bridge or approach area, rendering monitoring of a recognised danger spot actionless. 4. At the incident location, according to Hampshire Police Record Management Systems, there have been 12 crisis incidents in the last 5 years (of which the Police are aware) \u00ad including 7 self-harm ( jumping) attempts, 2 successful jumps from which the individual has survived and 3 fatalities. There have been a further 89 reported 'concern for safety' incidents at the location. 5. Wider reports of self-harm incidents and fatalities are well known from most of which do not have sufficent safety measures in place (as above) or means of summonsing help at a point of mental health crisis. 6.

I recommend that consideration is given to the setting up of an independent regulatory body to monitor on-line platform content with particular regard to the above. I recommend that consideration is given to enacting such legislation as may be necessary to ensure the protection of children from the effects of harmful on-line content and the effective regulation of harmful on-line content.

The ward layout did not lend itself to easy observation of patients. The Court\u2019s expert considered it \u2018wholly inadequate\u2019. The jury felt that this contributed more than minimally to Katharine\u2019s death. A number of rooms (including Katharine\u2019s room, 23) were remote from the nursing station and largely out of sight unless visited for a specific purpose. Whilst I am aware that some changes have been made since 2018, I am concerned that the current layout continues to place vulnerable patients, who might take their own lives, at risk. It is appreciated that the Trust might not be in a positon to create a ward which eliminates all of the layout issues. However, mitigation measures might be appropriate if the present facilities are to be used on an ongoing basis in an unmodified form. I am concerned that the limitations presented by the current layout may mean that staffing levels need to be adjusted to allow for greater levels of informal observation, oversight and monitoring. 2. The argument with her husband was a trigger event for Katharine. She was seen briefly by some ward staff between her return to the ward at around 10:25 and 11:00, but left completely unattended between 11:00-12:00. The jury felt that there was a missed opportunity at this time to affect the outcome and that the assessment of the risk that Katharine posed to herself had been inadequate. The evidence indicated that ward staff (seemingly regardless of their level of experience and seniority) who attend a patient in a situation like this are left to determine what (if any) action to take based upon their clinical judgement. In particular, it is left to the individual to decide whether escalation to a senior clinician would be appropriate and whether observations or monitoring (or even simply staying with the patient) should be increased for a period of time. I was told that it would not be unworkable in any scenario such as this (involving knowledge of a trigger event in the case of an impulsive patient with a known history of suicide attempts and self-harm) for there to be a procedure which called for an automatic review by the senior clinician on the ward at the time. However, that is not the current situation. I am concerned that, in the absence of a clear protocol, relatively junior staff (who may not be able to effect an adequate risk assessment) may not be equipped to determine how best to address the

The evidence in this inquest was that Cygnet\u2019s Ligature Risk Reduction Policy and the Ligature Audit Tool\/Ligature Risk Assessment are standard documents used by Mental Health inpatient providers, including NHS Psychiatric Trusts. - The Ligature Risk Reduction Policy quotes the CQC guidance of 2015, that \u201cThree-quarters of people who kill themselves whilst on a psychiatric ward do so by hanging or strangulation\u201d. - Whilst these documents provide detailed guidance in respect of minimising ligature anchor points, they do not give guidance as to minimising potential ligatures themselves, which are defined as \u201cAny item which can be used to make a loop or noose with the intention of limiting the supply of oxygen to an individual by hanging or asphyxiation\u201d. - Rather than emphasising the very real risk that specific items of clothing, , can pose to vulnerable patients, the document places emphasis on avoiding \u2018blanket restrictions\u2019 which does not assist in identifying where the real risks lie. - Death by the use of a ligature is likely to occur within a few minutes, whereas observations for a high-risk patient not assessed 4 RT4563 as being in immediate crisis, will generally be carried out four times in every hour, which therefore provides only a limited degree of risk reduction. Consideration should be given as to efficacy of such a policy and whether this can be improved by recognising that some items of clothing will be more obvious ligature risks and may need to be removed in all cases.

During his initial healthcare screening appointment on the evening he arrived at HMP Hewell ( 25.3.21 ) and his secondary healthcare screening appointment the following day, Mr. McDonald denied any mental health issues, and denied any current thoughts of suicide or self-harm. His community GP records were 2 requested and were received by the prison on 30.3.21; these showed a previous history of depression, and two previous drug overdoses, the most recent of which had been only 7 months earlier; 2) Despite this history, no appointment was made with Mr. McDonald by the healthcare or mental healthcare teams to follow this up with him, and discuss his mental health in more depth; 3) In his evidence to the inquest, the current Head of Healthcare at the prison conceded that it might have been appropriate for someone to have visited Mr. McDonald, raised with him what the GP summary had shown, and asked him if he would like any help, but that he would only have expected any such follow- up if there had been any current concerns about his mental health. He further confirmed that there would have been no automatic follow-up about this, even if staff believed that Mr. McDonald may have deliberately misled them about his mental health history during his healthcare screening appointments; 4) In subsequent correspondence to my office, the Head of Healthcare has suggested that it might be appropriate to delay a prisoner\u2019s secondary healthcare screening appointment until his GP records have been obtained and scrutinised, so that concerns about any history set out in those records can be raised with the prisoner. That proposal is due to be raised at the prison\u2019s next Local Quality Assurance Meeting; 5) I am concerned that there is currently no system in place at HMP Hewell to follow up with a prisoner any discrepancy between the mental health history which he has disclosed on arrival at the prison, and that revealed in his community GP records. Experience suggests that a prisoner with a recorded history of mental health issues, particularly one which includes a recent episode of attempted suicide or self-harm through overdose, may be at his most vulnerable during his first days and weeks at a prison, and having been reluctant to disclose such issues for any number of reasons ( e.g. fear, embarrassment ), may be reassured to be told that healthcare staff at the prison are aware of that history and can provide confidential support. In my view, without routine follow-up in such cases, there remains a significant risk that a prisoner\u2019s recent significant history of suicide or self-harm may be overlooked in those important

I found that Gareth was left without sufficient support, falling between 2 teams, who did not directly communicate with each other.",["gareth","williams","found","mental","health","could","improved","without","resolution","hearing","problems","tinnitus","untreatable","course","treatment","gareth","regularly","transferred","back","team","told","either","mental","health","ent","appropriate","speciality","found","gareth","left","without","sufficient","support","falling","teams","directly","communicate"],["gareth","williams","find","mental","health","could","improve","without","resolution","hearing","problem","tinnitus","untreatable","course","treatment","gareth","regularly","transfer","back","team","tell","either","mental","health","ent","appropriate","speciality","find","gareth","leave","without","sufficient","support","fall","team","directly","communicate"],[-0.0384076424,0.0155944824,-0.0118408203,0.0810767263,-0.1070387065,0.0505235456,0.062793307,-0.0598844141,0.0854899064,0.0052642822,-0.0514000803,-0.0898742676,-0.0432145856,0.0948850811,-0.0623881035,0.1451280415,0.0674955547,0.1215693131,-0.0015275744,-0.0572234243,0.0224045645,0.001494752,0.0214411411,0.0259975865,-0.0241086744,-0.052978728,-0.0932651088,0.049371507,0.0237880275,-0.0309785213,-0.0468020961,-0.0047363704,-0.0500183105,-0.0927013829,-0.0657077357,-0.0438906364,0.000644154,0.0117505388,0.0333938599,-0.0066880118,0.0292833112,-0.0099288095,0.0551283099,-0.0342542864,0.0012325711,-0.0898104012,0.0285356306,0.0058458117,-0.0965101421,0.0532862358,-0.0212185122,0.0438929722,-0.0918538868,-0.004778544,-0.0005705092,-0.033237882,-0.0472293422,-0.0455508754,0.0410107523,-0.1014942601,-0.043681886,0.0587408282,-0.0604943186,-0.0457526296,-0.0098676151,-0.0066155326,-0.032911513,0.0793719813,-0.0321725197,0.0758073628,0.0095926924,-0.0112355547,0.1001781896,0.0059695775,-0.1363862306,-0.0636850968,0.0355317853,0.0498419851,0.0205264613,0.0586018041,-0.0184733067,-0.0145314531,0.0240378901,0.0099995928,0.0680236816,-0.0263103917,-0.0790218785,0.0921851248,-0.016370561,-0.0348476842,0.0545611903,-0.0217132568,-0.0162887573,-0.0728810653,0.0339624621,-0.0547977015,0.0951851755,0.0483127162,0.0347782783,-0.0031382244,0.001554701,-0.0039401585,0.0410523936,0.0566194318,-0.018489413,0.0006948047,-0.0240546335,-0.0159772243,0.0721516088,-0.0452033132,-0.0308931135,-0.0182317104,-0.0215237141,-0.0213639997,0.0776091665,0.0157894567,0.0149216121,-0.0372204259,0.0574501902,0.0233688354,-0.125406906,0.0028788249,-0.0519048907,0.0276607946,0.005859375,-0.0898776576,-0.0810118765,-0.0610419363,0.0261510219,0.0233137347,-0.0018513998,-0.0889960378,-0.1212226003,-0.0394761823,-0.0347290039,-0.117970787,-0.0059064231,0.0462434553,0.003595988,0.0909712017,0.0931597799,-0.0329045206,-0.0247056745,0.0129191084,0.0159666277,0.0278303362,-0.0703941956,-0.0534939244,-0.057515461,-0.0095727704,0.1280553639,-0.0054766336,-0.0513500646,0.0458475761,-0.0141109889,-0.0426296666,-0.0171246007,-0.0523808785,-0.0636003315,-0.0214402936,0.0352757759,0.109754771,0.0505447388,-0.0013546414,-0.020612929,-0.1148529053,0.0302624181,-0.0400856882,0.0268448722,-0.012298584,-0.0031263563,-0.0013614231,-0.0354567617,-0.0873514786,-0.0100657148,0.0161183681,0.1047770157,-0.0802239329,-0.0717671737,0.005534702,-0.0790193379,-0.0185580775,0.015894996,0.0271352138,-0.0080735944,0.003507826,-0.0559408404,0.0047361585,0.0518756434,0.026767306,-0.0050862632,-0.0074471366,-0.0035976833,-0.0042334665,0.0263061523,-0.0070817736,0.013128493,-0.0447633527,-0.0523842722,-0.0753356069,-0.0344170481,0.0812157542,-0.0395948626,-0.0232891515,0.0379655622,-0.0337113291,-0.0128580732,0.0060219234,0.0548319817,-0.0309265982,-0.0459103063,-0.0188365504,-0.0657251179,0.0114546884,-0.1191813126,-0.0075534582,0.1015650406,-0.0656958669,-0.1380140483,-0.0587395579,-0.0750668868,0.0095163984,0.0093922084,0.0297556985,0.0505625419,-0.0723097026,0.0667283833,0.0086110961,-0.0417802595,0.0534684919,0.0307710432,-0.0221667811,0.0171966553,-0.0050845677,0.0384030864,-0.0198063329,0.0061340332,-0.0066833496,0.0590879656,0.0151822828,0.0032721625,-0.0237333514,0.0114356149,-0.0717883632,0.0146980286,0.0465376116,-0.0001220703,0.0305514857,0.0091453129,-0.0290463772,0.0579545759,-0.0062493216,0.0360047035,0.0926589966,0.0448201485,-0.0712551549,0.0154772867,0.0742259547,-0.0414326973,0.0404952355,-0.0086593628,-0.0355699323,-0.0470174141,0.0640936941,0.0200744197,0.0415106863,-0.0148203112,-0.0233586635,-0.0597839355,-0.0556979701,0.0426300913,0.0802612305,0.0614081472,-0.0099970503,0.0464528389,-0.074384056,-0.0671700388,-0.1246710867,-0.0664452463,0.0046981703,0.013666789,-0.0143763227,0.1008029506,0.0728526637,-0.033532884,0.0075609419,-0.0466391258,0.0022269355,0.1101108119,0.0833002701,-0.0177866612,0.1359117329,-0.0272750854,0.0253172982,-0.0686119944,0.0710458755,-0.0632010028,-0.0458780937,0.0286216736,0.022314284]],["1. During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. Mr Honnor had researched on the internet how to obtain a gas cannister with a view to ending his life. ii. It is not known when or where he purchased this item. iii. There is no restriction on members of the public purchasing these items. iv. Separate consideration needs to be given to the labelling and colouring of gas cylinders to enable emergency services to respond to any risk arising at an incident. v. The police found the vehicle with Mr Honnor in and the cannister. They removed him to commence CPR.The officers put themselves at risk in entering the vehicle which contained the gas cannister. Evidence was heard at the inquest from a police inspector that officers attending emergencies need to be able to identify gas cannisters by colour coding. vi. The gas cylinder had the following labelling: and details the warnings of gas under pressure, odourless and asphyxiation- do not inhale. Non-in-flammable, Non -toxic Gas2 with an emergency phone number. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. I have concerns that members of the public are able to purchase or acquire . ii. I have concerns that these products should be licensed. iii. I have concerns that there is no colour coding of gas cylinders to assist first response emergency services. iv.

Whilst Mr Lloyd had some interactions with mental and health services, and was under the care of a charity who provides support as a consequence of alcohol and drug addiction, it is a matter of concern that he did not have ready access to a dual-diagnosis service locally. A unified service of this nature, employing appropriate specialists, would have the benefit of being able to assess and treat mental-health conditions existing alongside substance misuse issues in a coherent and holistic manner. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21st October 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to on behalf of Mr Lloyd\u2019s family. I have also sent a copy to Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust and Greater Manchester Police as other Interested Persons to the case. I have sent a copy of my report to the Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, Change Grow Live (My Recovery, Tameside) and Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership, who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner.

Following the admission by Dr Winslow in 2020 that he had taken medicines from the Trust with a view to ending his life, it is a matter of concern that the case was not formally referred to the Police and the General Medical Council. Making such referrals would have had the potential benefit of:\u00ad i) Providing the Trust with ready access to external advice as to the adequacy (or otherwise) of steps taken to mitigate the future risk of staff members misappropriating medicines with a view to self-harming; and ii) Offered access to a mechanism whereby objective analysis of Dr Winslow\u2019s fitness to practise as a Consultant Anaesthetist (both from a health and broader perspective) could have taken place; 2. In December 2020, the Trust became aware that, whilst on sick leave from the NHS, Dr Winslow had continued with his private practice notwithstanding an explicit instruction from his manager to the effect that he should refrain from all work. It is a further matter of concern that this development did not, of itself, cause the Trust to reconsider its position and make the referrals set out above; 3. In the absence of any meaningful external review of the case as a whole, it is a particular concern that most of the actions which followed the theft of medication by Dr Winslow in 2020 appear to have been taken as a result of decisions made by members of the Trust\u2019s medical hierarchy. In view of the gravity of the issues raised by Dr Winslow\u2019s misappropriation of drugs in 2020, and the previous suicide of a Consultant Anaesthetist employed by the Trust involving misuse of prescription medicines, it is a matter of concern that a more multi-disciplinary approach was not taken, perhaps overseen by someone such as a non-executive director of the organisation. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12th October 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to on behalf of Dr Winslow\u2019s family. I have sent a copy of my report to the General Medical Council, the Care Quality Commission and NHS England, who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner.

During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. Mr Moore had a history of problems with alcohol. ii. A CT scan in January 2021 revealed a fatty liver. 2 iii. Mr Moore was admitted to hospital on the 2nd May 2021 complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting. When discharged from hospital on the 7th May 2021 it was noted that he had been consuming a bottle of whiskey per day. On the 19th May Mr Moore was prescribed following a telephone conversation between a paramedic attending upon Mr Moore and a doctor at the surgery. iv. On the 21st May Mr Moore\u2019s sister wrote to the surgery summarising her concerns for her brother and querying the medication that he had been prescribed. The surgery had no consent from Mr Moore to release any information to his sister. The We Are With You charity that offers free confidential advice to people with drug, alcohol or mental health issues were currently engaging with Mr Moore, they also raised concerns about the medication following a e-mail from Mr Moore\u2019s sister. v. At a Significant Event meeting at the surgery when Mr Moore\u2019s case was discussed by doctors, it was agreed that the amount of was potentially unsafe and a lesser amount should have been prescribed. vi. The appears to be no documentation of Mr Moore being contacted and notified of these concerns. vii. On the 27th May 2021 Mr Moore when was spoken to on the telephone by the surgery, there is no documentation that the concerns about were discussed with him. viii. On the 29th July 2021 Mr Moore when was seen by a doctor at the surgery, there is no documentation that the concerns were discussed with him. Mr Moore told the doctor that he had no thoughts of suicide and was reducing his alcohol intake. ix. Mr Moore continued to engage with We Are With You and had one to one sessions on the 27th July 2021 and the 3rd August 2021. x. The use of and excess alcohol together could cause death. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. There could be the death of a person in the future due to combined use of and excess alcohol and I request that consideration is given to creating a policy at the surgery to cover patients who are prescribed , at the same time as consuming alcohol to excess. ii. I would request consideration is given as to the advice to be given in the circumstances where a patient is not being seen face to face, but via another healthcare worker. iii. Further, consideration should be given to the amount and dosage that should be prescribed in these circumstances and 3 whether there should be a documented process to highlight any concerns about the use of being brought to the patient\u2019s attention as soon as possible. iv. I would request consideration is given that within the policy there is provision for a follow up face to face meeting to review the medication. v.

was failed by the Mental Health Services quite frankly due to the current lack of resourcing and provision in place to support young people struggling with their mental health. Due to the lack of availability of a Child Psychiatrist there are long waiting times for children to be assessed. Robyn was not seen by a Child Psychiatrist and\/or Psychologist, despite there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling her to be diagnosed and receive a treatment plan. Robyn\u2019s parents did everything they could during this period to support Robyn, including paying for a private counsellor, but sadly Robyn\u2019s mental health continued to deteriorate during this time, and she took her own life. Robyn initial acceptance into tier 3 Children and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) similarly did not happen in a timely manner.  I do appreciate that the landscape that the local mental health Trust (Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust) was working under and the fact that Covid heightened the level of complexity across many services but there were many failings in the care provided to Robyn. It became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant under funding of the local mental health Trust who like many mental health Trusts have seen an explosion of referrals to their Children and Mental Health services (CAMHS). By way of an example:- Referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6% from May 2019 (389) to May 2022 (761) West Sussex CAMHS caseload has increased by 85% from May 2019 (2239) to May 2022 (4147) West Sussex CAMHS Duty caseload has increased by 112% from May 2021 (492) to May 2022 (1494) Mental Health A&E presentations, in period April 2021 - March 2022, have increased by 40% on previous year (April 2020 - March 2021). Additionally, across Sussex CAMHS, as a whole, the referrals data shows:- \u2022 May 2022 was the highest number of referrals the service has ever received (1350). \u2022 Of those 1350 referrals, 80% (1,081) were accepted into the service. \u2022 In comparison, in May 2019, 579 were accepted (65% accepted) \u2022 So, an additional 502 young people have been accepted in May 2022 compared to May 2019 Despite the increase in numbers accessing CAMHS there has not been any relative increase in resources to meet this demand and therefore the current position is is unsustainable and it is putting

evidence of Detective Inspector , Tactical and Policy Lead for MPS, highlighted a concern that in tasking and transferring investigations between bordering Police forces, there is a lack of ownership and discussion between officers at Inspector level or above between forces, which would ensure effective tasking and, when necessary, smooth transfer of investigations. Requests were made by email and CAD, without discussions between officers. This was confirmed in the evidence of Detective Chief Constable of SP, who stated that from her lingerie there was a lack of feedback from SP to manage MPS\u2019 expectations regarding a search for Mr Boughton. In respect of the initial search, this meant that SP did not advise MPS that they considered the search request unfeasible given the extent of land outlined and the limitations on searching wooded areas during winter night hours. In respect of the request for a further search with more precise location detailed provided, MPS did not disclose all of the information available 3 RT4563 regarding Family and friends potentially being able to assist in finding the location based upon where Mr Boughton used to visit. There was no feedback from SP regarding when a search might take place, leading MPS to consider deploying its own search team. Whilst contact telephone numbers for Officers at MPS and SP were provided on the CAD, there is no evidence that direct contact was made between the forces to discuss the investigation and how best to move this forward. A SP officer recorded on the CAD that until the transfer document was received from MPS, SP were unable to arrange a search or contact the specialist search team. Whilst DI gave evidence that he is aware the NPCC is reviewing issuing guidance around tasking and transfers between bordering Police forces, at present there appears to be no requirement for appropriate Police Officers to make telephone contact between forces to ensure effective tasking and transferring, in addition to the required written requests. This means an opportunity to discuss and pass on all relevant information between forces may be lost. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: 1. The lack of any detailed requirement for telephone discussion between appropriate police officers on sending through written tasking requests and considering transfers of investigation means that an opportunity to discuss and ensure smooth transition and passing on of relevant information is lost. This may cause delay in effective action being taken by the tasked Force, or (in the case of transfers) by the Force to whom it is considered a transfer will be made.

Evidence was heard regarding the manner in which information crucial to the formulation of risk assessments was recorded and shared: a)Two types of risk assessments were completed, with no system to ensure that important information is present on both; b) The previous incident in which Archi had attempted to take his own life in very similar circumstances on the ward was not clearly entered on the risk assessments used by staff and therefore not known to a number of those responsible for his care; c) Those responsible for his care accepted that the above incident was one of which they would have wanted to have knowledge; d) The absence of that information may have affected the subsequent decisions made regarding the setting of risk level, observation level and removal of potentially dangerous ligature items. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.

the evidence I heard, the Care Coordinator\u2019s role is to assess the patient\u2019s care needs and to plan and review those needs across the broad spectrum of physical and mental health and social needs within the multi-disciplinary team within the Mental Health Trust. The Care Coordinator is the individual who has the closest contact with the patient and, as the title suggests, is the liaison link for every other professional and agency. From the evidence, it is clear that an enormous burden of responsibility and reliance is placed on the individual Care Coordinator as they are expected to be the conduit of information to other professionals and to continuously review and assess all areas of the patient\u2019s needs and to call in others as required. I concluded that the only person who had the ability to have a comprehensive view of Ms Flint\u2019s mental health was the Care Coordinator and the quality of the information provided to others within the multi-disciplinary team and other agencies was entirely dependent on the ability, availability, resources, experience, training and skills of the Care Coordinator. (1) From the evidence, it appeared that the precise job description and requirements of Care coordinators differs between local Trusts so that there is no consistency as to the way in which individual Care coordinators are expected to fulfil their role. (2) It also emerged that the resources available to the Community Mental Health Teams are limited so that in the absence of a Care Coordinator during periods of annual leave or sickness, there was no

One The inquest heard that the Priory had identified that the garden fence was a risk, in particular the section over the door, in about December 2019. There had been a number of escapes both over the fence and through it, in the months leading up to James\u2019 escape. The number of escapes indicates that garden area was not safe. There was a plan to replace it but there were other priorities. More striking was that there is no national guidance for perimeter fencing and security for the outside areas of mental health \u2018locked wards\u2019; unlike that in existence for mental health \u2018secure units\u2019. In particular, the height of the fence. While it is accepted that national guidance ought not be necessary to carry out appropriate risk assessments and ensure secure\/safe spaces it is clear that such guidance is necessary to ensure the correct level of security for vulnerable patients, whilst benefitting from the therapeutic setting of an outdoor space. Matter Two The evidence showed that there was no appreciation of the emerging pattern of behaviour. A major contributing factor was the lack of exchange and transfer of information at the handover between the consecutive shifts. In particular, the form specifically designed for this with a section for completion \u2013 \u2018Incidents in last 7 days\u2019 which would have provided an information flow through was not completed. Whilst I heard evidence of steps taken to improve information exchange at a higher level than between ward staff (nurses and HCAs) I was very surprised to hear that no audit of these \u2018handover documents\u2019 had been carried out. Given the fundamental importance of the exchange of information between each shift and consecutive shifts I am of the opinion that The Priory have not carried out a sufficiently robust review. Until this failure is addressed there is a significant risk of a breakdown in the communication of adverse events across the shift pattern of several days.

I was told that the Crisis Recovery and Home Treatment Team (\"CRHT\") use the Care Partner records, a whiteboard and a manual diary to enter the various information and action points and that it is at the Multidisciplinary Team meetings that the actions or steps are discussed and progressed. They are either crossed out,if completed, or moved to the next date until they have been actioned. It was highlighted that in this particular case two actions were not completed either prior to Kieran\u2019s discharge from the CRHT or shortly thereafter. In one of these, the entry had been crossed out, giving the impression that the matter had, in fact been dealt with when it had not. This indicated that there was an issue as to the monitoring and execution of such actions or steps. This anomaly whereby a significant step may have been overlooked remains a concern. 5 (2) The evidence I heard from one witness described how she was asked to contact Kieran by telephone and to advise him of the fact that a Multi-agency Referral Form (\u201cMARF\u201d) was to be submitted. I considered this was an inappropriate means of communicating a significant procedure and which could potentially bear on his (or any other vulnerable person's) state of mind. What was unclear is how the provision of this information and step to be taken will be approached in future. (3) I expressed concern that someone having been discharged from the CRHT, there appeared to be no route back into the Mental Health Service short of a re-referral to the CRHT itself via A & E for someone who remains vulnerable by reason of their mental state and who is receiving therapy as part of the discharge plan. This is in the context of someone who was receiving support from the Integrated Psychology Therapy Service (\u201cIPTS\u201d) and the Dyfed Drug and Alcohol Service (\u201cDDAS\u201d), both of whom were engaged in providing appropriate therapies. My concern is that there appears to be an issue in relation to lines of communication and information sharing between Primary Mental Health Services and Tier 2 providers of therapy. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN 6 In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you Hywel Dda University Health Board have the power to take such action.

How can a person displaying suicidal ideation be kept safe, if deemed not to be mentally ill? (2) Daniel Clements was a troubled young man aged 27. He had a low IQ, little education and was not fully compliant with his prescribed Risperidone medication (used to treat psychotic illness). He had always been dependent upon his mother, but when she was admitted to a care home in February 2021 (during the Coronavirus pandemic) he became homeless and adrift in society. In short, he was a vulnerable young man. 1 (3) In the fortnight before his death Mr Clements had the following interactions with healthcare professionals: a) On 6 July 2021 he attended an A&E department and reported a deterioration in his mental health with symptoms of anxiety, inability to sleep, drug debts and homelessness, which were deemed attributable to his social situation rather than mental illness. He was referred back to his GP and advised to contact the police if he became concerned about his own safety. He was considered at that time to have the mental capacity to make choices affecting his social situation. b) On 8 July 2021 he sought help from his GP and was referred to the Crisis Team (the Intensive Home-Based Treatment Team). c) On 12 July 2021 his brother contacted the Single Point of Access to voice concerns about his mental state as Mr Clements was phoning him through the night and coming to his home. A representative from the Single Point of Access discussed with the brother options which included seeking an injunction against Mr Clements. He had sought a replacement prescription from his GP but had allegedly been refused an early issue of his medication. d) On 19 July 2021 Mr Clements was brought by the police to the A&E Department at Pinderfields Hospital who referred him to the Psychiatrist Liaison Team. He was assessed by a registered mental health nurse and a Psychiatric Liaison Practitioner. They concluded he did not present with any symptoms indicative of an acute mental illness. He said in response to a direct question that he was \"always suicidal\". Mr Clements was advised to collect his medication from the pharmacy, to work with housing, pay some of his drug debts and was given a leaflet outlining the Psychiatric Liaison Team Service. (4) Mr Clements was passed between agencies without any lasting benefit. This tragic situation illustrates the void in relation to those with suicidal feelings without any overt psychiatric illness. (5) The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care is asked to consider whether an extension to the Section 136 Mental Health Act 1983 power is required in order that a person such as Mr Clements could be detained for a few days in order to help him through a period of crisis. In this period a multi-disciplinary meeting involving the family, social worker, GP and psychiatric specialist might devise a plan to combat the social problems which otherwise devour the time of healthcare professionals without any conspicuous gain ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and the Trust have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 5 September 2022. I, the Coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 2 6 7 8 9 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 1. , Sister 2. , Brother 3. White Rose Surgery 4. British Transport Police, FAO: 5. , South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner.

Mr McLellan was diagnosed over 2016\/16 as being autistic with a designation of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. He was also diagnosed as experiencing Bipolar Disorder, an attribution he did not accept which he repeatedly asserted to both previous Mental Health care providers and the subsequent Trust clinicians tasked with supporting him at the time of his death, Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust (\u201cTEWV\u201d) 2 He insisted his difficulties were linked to his autism and not mental disorder. It was accepted that he experienced autism and that was part of his individuality and that in addition he may have had a mental health disorder. It was accepted that his care and treatment cannot unbundle the two but he should be treated holistically. 3 Assessment and formulation of risks and safety summary did not fully explore the impact of his autism. There was little to suggest that TEWV staff a) considered the higher prevalence of suicide for individuals with a diagnosis of autism and b) that Regulation 28 \u2013 After Inquest OFFICIAL - SENSITIVE Document Template Updated 30\/07\/2021 Mr McLellan may have communicated his distress and risks information differently to an individual without a diagnosis of autism during his periods of crisis or increased risk and c) made sufficient reasonable adjustments in relation to the impact of his autism. 4 At the time of his death, TEWV had progressed from a low baseline in the Trust\u2019s work in North Yorkshire to address perceived underdevelopment in their services for the autistic patient when presenting with a mental health disorder. It had expanded the use of a specialist team (Autism Project Team- \u201cAPT\u201d) to extend its work into North Yorkshire caseload. The steps taken were incremental and not all staff understood that Team and access to that important resource. It is recognised that improvements would take time and be resource dependent as well however. 5 APT has three specialist and autism dedicated practitioners working exclusively with autism across the whole Trust in both its regions of commissioned care although there are also non-dedicated clinicians with some expertise of autism within TEWV. TEWV does not treat autism in North Yorkshire. 6 TEWV in its recent audit indicates about 17% of the individuals open to TEWV (over 10,000 in number) have an autism marker ie have an ICD-10 diagnosis of autism or experience suspected\/confirmed autism or have a referral including being suspected as autistic. 7 There was no direct causation to the suicide found that directly attributed the acts he took to his autism from the evidence. However Mr McLellan\u2019s distress and stressors before his death included his feelings that he was not getting what he saw to be the right help and that he would not lose his feelings of helplessness such that he took his own life. The concern is that the very significant number of those open to TEWV with an autism marker has increased and will continue to do so and that the higher prevalence of suicide within that expanding group will lead to higher risk of, and numbers of, autistic individuals dying because of suicide both within TEWV locality but also nationally. Urgent solutions are required to prevent further deaths of autistic individuals especially those with mental health disorder by rapidly improving and expanding provisions for assessment and management

Evidence was taken at the different inquest that: (i) HMP Leeds has only 3 days per week of a psychiatrist's time available (ii) HMP Leeds has some 5000 prisoners arriving each year. (iii) A large proportion of the prisoners arriving have mental health issues (iv) The mental health team is mainly a nurse-led service (v) The division of labour between mental health nurses and psychiatrists is that a doctor is responsible for the diagnosis of mental illness, prescribing medication such as anti-psychotic drugs and seeing prisoners\/patients with severe or complex conditions. Mental health nurses make initial assessments and provide ongoing care. (vi) Concern was expressed about the adequacy of the psychiatric doctor provision to provide psychiatric treatment for a large population which includes men with significant mental health issues. (vii) Mr Noble was deemed to require assessment by a psychiatrist on 14 July 2020 as a non-urgent case but at the time of his death on 15 August 2020 no appointment had been given. 1 (viii) A mental health nurse working on behalf of PPG on 10 July 2020 identified the 11 possibility of emerging psychotic features\" and noted the sentiment that engaging in treatment as soon as possible militated in favour of a better outcome. Where such a suspicion was raised it would have been advantageous to obtain a second opinion from a psychiatrist swiftly (particularly after his mother contacted the prison to report his paranoid and bizarre conversation regarding a gun, a secret room in the prison and some unknown person trying to kill him.) (2) It is acknowledged that evidence was given at the inquest that: (i) PPG could draw additional psychiatric input from elsewhere in the PPG group, but there was no evidence to indicate when, if ever, this was last done. (ii) Waiting times for an appointment with a psychiatrist in the community could be 5 months or more and thus the principle of equivalence of care was achieved. (3) Concern was expressed in the course of the inquest that the meagre provision of psychiatric consultant availability might deter mental health nurses from making referrals. This concern was not accepted on behalf of PPG. Despite this the concern remains that a self-fulfilling prophecy has inadvertently been created in which referrals are not made because there is no resource to respond to any which may be made (4) The concerns raised mirrored issues raised in an inquest which concluded on 1 June 2022 relating to the death of Mohammed lrfaan Afzal in HM Prison Leeds on 4 August 2019. In a narrative conclusion the jury concluded that despite an urgent referral to a psychiatrist on 15 July 2019, no appointment had been provided before his death on 4 August 2019, \"it is possible that the delays in providing treatment contributed more than minimally to Mr Afzal's death\". (5) In view of these concerns PPG are asked to review the availability of psychiatrists at HMP Leeds to determine whether it is sufficient to meet the needs of a cohort of mentally unwell prisoners. 6 7 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action.

The post-incident site report presented by British Transport Police (in conjunction with the Design Out Crime Unit) and completed on 22 July 2021 identified that there was (and remains) limited staffing and CCTV surveillance at Portchester Railway Station and limited visibility of the platforms - requiring a security risk assessment with a view to increasing staffing (at the ticket office and on the platform) with increased RCO Patrols and platform surveillance and that additional CCTV installation and coverage was required (of the platforms and public areas) with real time capability. (2) The post-incident site report further identified that Portchester Railway station is an impending \u2018escalated\u2019 location. Since 2017 there have been 2 previous fatalities in similar circumstances at the station \u2013 which is now recognised as having lower levels of surveillance \u2013 with Mr Davies\u2019 death being the third. Although recommendations were made after the first incident, the above recommendations and identified risks (at 1) have not yet been (fully) addressed or implemented. (3) The post-incident site report further identified the lack of public security and welfare announcements at the station (and within the station concourse) aimed at providing direction in the event of illness or of assistance being required. There is a lack of information\/announcements to other members of the public as to how to obtain assistance if they are concerned by someone else\u2019s condition or actions.

(Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Low Care Limited, referred to collectively as \u2018Nightingales\u2019) Whereas the court heard evidence that Nightingales would not accept another patient with an equivalent medical profile\/history and that, should a resident within one of Nightingales\u2019 homes require access to items to be restricted, they would be given 1:1 support pending a mental health assessment and discharge to a more appropriate facility, it was not possible for the home concerned to advise the court as to how and by whom the lead in question had been returned to Mrs Stringer. The concern arises that, in the case of a resident whose care requires access to items to be restricted, there should be a fail- safe, documented system, known to and implemented by staff, by which access to those items by the resident is prevented. In the circumstances that the possibility of a resident requiring such care may still arise, this concern exists notwithstanding the decisions now made. 2) (Addressed to Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited, referred to collectively as \u2018Nightingales\u2019) The court heard evidence as to the potential detrimental effects of isolation and loneliness in the elderly, including evidence from the court appointed expert that isolation can be very corrosive, that it is the single most potent causative risk factor for depression in the elderly and that it can have a very detrimental effect on a person\u2019s mental state. There is a need for this to be known amongst staff. The concern arises as one member of staff gave (disputed) evidence that they had little or no training in such matters. 3) (Addressed to Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Lancashire County Council, Nightingales Care Limited and Zion Care Limited (the latter referred to collectively as \u2018Nightingales\u2019)) The court heard evidence and\/or found that a number of steps had not been taken pertaining to the transfer of information concerning Mrs Stringer\u2019s risk of suicide. They included the following: i. The care coordinator should have requested that the acute hospital make a referral to the Mental Health Liaison Team for a review; ii. It would have been good practice for a further professionals meeting \/ CPA review to have taken place prior to formal discharge and no later than just after discharge to Nightingales and for the family to have been invited, to ensure that everyone was aware of the plan, that the family was aware of Mrs Stringer\u2019s legal status and to discuss next steps in terms of liaison with other services; iii. There should have been greater professional curiosity and better communication at the time of transfer; iv. The Harbour mental health hospital\u2019s RNNA should have been reviewed to determine whether it needed to be updated and it should have been updated if there was any different clinical information. Further self harm or suicidal ideation, if seen to be significant, should have given rise to a further RNNA; v. There had, in fact, been further indications of self harm and suicidal ideation and, in any event, of a wish to die, on 30th June 2020, in August 2020 and on 3rd September 2020 which were significant and should have been addressed in the information provided to Nightingales and had not been; vi. Mrs Stringer was discharged from The Harbour mental health hospital without an up-to-date Care Act Assessment and, in any event, taking into account the need for Mrs Stringer to be transferred to the acute hospital (which had been necessary), an up-to-date Care Act Assessment had not been completed during the period of her admission to the latter hospital; vii. The risk assessment should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; viii. A positive behaviour support plan should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; ix. A care plan, compliant with CPA Policy and Procedures Key Standard 10, which should have identified a suitable environment in which to manage Mrs Stringer\u2019s risk, her needs and mental health and crisis and contingency planning, to cater for the event of a significant relapse in her mental health, should have been completed and provided to Nightingales; x. Risk behaviour should have been identified to Nightingales and context given, whereas that had not been the case in respect of certain behaviour, including the incident on 30th June 2020; xi. The care coordinator should have been better informed at the points of transfer and discharge; xii. There should have been more robust follow up by the care coordinator whilst Mrs Stringer was at the acute hospital; xiii. There had been no mental health service involvement between the 7-day follow up and 28th September 2020 or, if there had, it had not been recorded; xiv. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not possible for a manager to carry out a face-to-face assessment in the mental health hospital but no equivalent measure had been implemented; xv) Whereas it would have been helpful for Nightingales to have received the Continuing Healthcare Checklist, it had not been provided; xvi) Nightingales would have wished to see the risk of suicide referred to in the \u201cRisks to the Service User\u201d section of the FACE Overview Assessment; xvii) The court appointed expert had concerns about the accessibility of key information in the FACE Overview Assessment given the format of that document. Whereas the court heard evidence concerning subsequent, significant, purposeful, developments in practice, the matters listed above can be condensed into a single concern that there should be a comprehensive, cohesive, frictionless system for the timely collation (including from the family and\/or other carers) and timely communication \/ transfer of sufficient, accessible information ((not, simply, risk assessments) pertaining to suicide risk in patients \/ service users \/ residents, by and between each of the service providers

I heard evidence that following a review in 2015 changes to the ACCT document and process were piloted in 10 establishments in 2019 and this included HMP Swansea. As a result a revised ACCT version 6 and accompanying policy guidance was issued. This revised guidance makes clear that an ACCT must be opened by any member of staff who receives information that indicates a prisoner may be currently at risk of self-harm or suicide and that this information may come from a prison escort. However, this requirement is not new. It was clear in my view from the HMP Swansea Suicide and Prevention Policy that was in place at the time of Khalid's death that a warning marker for suicide on a prison escort record ('PER') should result in the opening of an ACCT. The prison officer who saw Khalid first in reception gave evidence that he was an experienced prison officer with over 20 years-experience of working in prisons including 18 years at HMP Swansea. At the time when Khalid came into custody he was an ACCT assessor and remains in this role. He saw Khalid's PER which stated that Khalid had recently made threats to kill himself and was alleging mental health issues and he saw the NOEMIS transfer report which contained reference to historic ACCTs that Khalid had been on in custody and an act of cutting and ligaturing by Khalid 9 months before in December 2015. He did not open an ACCT but referred to the nurse who also did not open an ACCT. In his evidence the Prison Officer stated that if a prisoner came into custody now in 2022 with a warning on his PER stating that he has recently made threats to kill himself then this would not be enough to trigger the opening of an ACCT. This view is inconsistent with the mandatory revised ACCT policy quidance that I have set out above. This indicates that the system for trainina on 2 ACCT in HMP Swansea is inadequate. The Prison Officer could not recall whether his ACCT training was up to date. His training records show that he was ACCT trained in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2014 and I am told there was training on the new ACCT document that is not recorded in the training records and a further up-skilling session with staff date not specified. I did hear that training was difficult during the Covid 19 pandemic in HMP Swansea, however, ACCT training is required to be carried out with much more frequency than the training provided to the officer on reception and staff should understand the warning markers that require an ACCT to be opened. I am concerned that unless prison officers are provided with frequent ACCT training which is kept up to date then there remains a risk of similar deaths occurring in the future in HMP Swansea. 2. I heard evidence from the nurse who saw Khalid on reception. This person is an experienced mental health nurse who is now a charge nurse on bank. The nurse told me that he still does at times work through the bank as a mental health nurse in HMP Swansea. At the time of Khalid's death the Nurse was the mental health nurse working on reception and he completed the first reception health screen for Khalid and he did not open an ACCT. It was unclear what documents the nurse had seen on reception for Khalid but he did not asked prison staff if he could see any documents. The Nurse gave evidence that even if he had known that there was a suicide warning marker on Khalid's prison escort record this would not have been enough combined with what Khalid said to him to open an ACCT, he relies on Khalid's presentation. Khalid had been assessed by a consultant psychiatrist as a significant risk to himself a matter of weeks before he was seen by the Nurse in reception. HMP Swansea prison staff and the Nurse were not aware of this information but even if the Nurse had known this information his evidence was that this would not necessarily have been enough for him to open an ACCT, he would consider presentation. The revised ACCT version 6 and accompanying policy guidance set out above makes clear that an ACCT must be opened by any member of staff who receives information that indicates a prisoner may be currently at risk of self-harm or suicide and that this information may come from a prison escort. The answers of the Nurse raise a concern around the level and adequacy of the training on ACCT. The Nurse stated that he has reflected on his practice but that he still places emphasis on what the prisoner says and how they present when considering whether to open an ACCT. I heard evidence that bank nurses were supervised in the prison but that training on ACCT remained the responsibility of HMP Swansea. I am concerned that a bank nurse may not receive access to ACCT training including at the required regularity and I am concerned that unless this happens there remains a risk of similar deaths

mental health services went through a transformation process during the Covid pandemic. It became apparent that the anticipated level of direct referrals to the service from primary care was many times in excess of those predicted. The expectation was 6 per day, at the peak this rose to 30 and has currently reduced to 13-14 daily, so remains over 100% above the anticipated level. The inquest was advised that the service was failing to meet the service demands due to insufficient capacity. The decision was made to enter this onto the Trust\u2019s risk register, and this remains the situation. The critical features remain a high demand for services and a lack of resources. This court has been told on many occasions that there is an intention for \u201cparity\u201d of mental 2 health services with physical health services, but this is not apparent and the service is unable to meet its obligations now or going forward. This is greater than a \u201clong waiting list\u201d issue and is not a situation that can be explained exclusively by the covid pandemic. A more significant risk to individuals requiring mental health services has now arisen than existed before the transformation programme; it creates a real concern that lives will be lost as a consequence, and no solution was offered to the court during the inquest.

During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. Mr Nixon was not known to mental health services prior to February 2021. ii. Mr Nixon's accompanied him to every appointment he had with the Home Treatment Team. She had never had dealings with the Mental Health Services previously. iii. Mr Nixon had given permission to the Mental Health Services to share information with . On one occasion it was deemed that a doctor could not impart patient information to Mr Nixon's because he wrongly thought he did not have permission from the patient to do so. iv. Mr Nixon's was unaware that he had disclosed \"occasional suicidal thoughts\" and was therefore unable to assess the risk of Mr Nixon to himself and accordingly did not take any steps to protect him. v. The Care Plan, Escalation Plan, Emergency Plan were not drawn up in writing until after Mr Nixon's death. No paperwork was sent to Mr Nixon (and in turn not seen by his partner) by the Home Treatment Team prior to his death. Mr Nixon's partner was not therefore party to or privy to any risk assessment. vi. A Carer's Assessment was considered but thought not appropriate as it was believed that Mr Nixon's (who was present at all consultations with the Home Treatment Team) was part of what was seen as ''an intelligent and resourceful couple\". vii. The Trust has a patient information leaflet describing what support and advice can be given to a carer. There is a Carer Assessment tool available. 2 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. The failure to ensure that family members\/carers are fully involved from the outset in the risk assessment process and that they have a full comprehension of steps being taken and\/or decisions being made. I believe the Trust should take a more proactive approach. ii. There should be criteria to be applied as to who should be considered for a Carer's Assessment at the earliest appointment with the Home Treatment Team. Such criteria should include whether the patient has given permission to share information; whether the patient and\/or the carer have been involved with mental health services previously; whether the carer has been\/will be present during consultations; the level of understanding of the carer in relation to steps taken and decisions made and whether they need further help. iii. Such criteria may lead to a full carer's assessment. It is noted that there will always be a delay between assessments and the drawing up of care plans etc which will then be sent out to the patient.

The assessment of Sam's risk of self-harm was recorded by his care-co- ordinator in a Wales Applied Risk Research Network (WARRN) assessment tool in March 2019. This form of assessment was adopted by the Integrated Mental Health Services (Powys County Council & Powys Teaching Health Board) in Powys. I also received evidence that it is used throughout Wales by similar services. (2) The evidence I received indicated that the WARRN assessment documentation\/tool could be routinely accessed, updated & revised by the Integrated Team. It was a fluid document for the purpose of recording information as to the current assessment of risk(s) of self-harm & how that risk(s) was to be mitigated. Whilst I received evidence that in practice, such risk assessments were being undertaken with Sam, the WARRN documentation did not necessarily reflect that, nor was it optimally viewable in terms of clearly recording fluctuating presentations & any accompanying re-assessment of risk. (3) It appeared to me that the format\/layout of the WARRN tool, its accessibility, & in particular, its ability to provide a user with clear & easily viewable information as to how Sam's risk of self-harm had fluctuated\/altered\/changed in the months preceding his death, could lead to important information\/assessments being lost to a new\/infrequent user. This, for example, might be a new care co-ordinator (as in Sam's case), Crisis Team\/Community Nurse, or clinician not previously involved with Sam. (4) Given the variety of services involved in Sam's care, this central document, addressing & recording fluctuating risk appeared to me to be a crucial document in the recording of current risk (my emphasis). The ability of those charged with Sam's care to view those fluctuations might be hampered by the current presentation of\/access to such information. That could lead to an under- estimation of the current risk & sub-optimal mitigating measures being put in place. (5) The WARRN assessment tool might also benefit from a greater degree of interaction between it & the user. For example, it was clear, on the evidence that Social Worker's, Mental Health Nurses & Clinicians were all busy addressing the needs (& assessing risk) of a wide number & variety of patients. Prompting (my emphasis) the user to consider & record referrals for, for example, to advocacy services & for capacity assessments might optimise the benefits of the tool & reduce the risk of such opportunities being missed\/un-recorded. Such then leading to the potential absence of key information for new\/infrequent users when assessing risks of self-harm It may well be helpful (given the Integrated Services approach to Mental

Concerns heard during the evidence atthe inquest include: 1. There is a need within the Trust for better continuity of care. There are not enough care co-ordinators to ensure that continuity of care is provided. There are high turnovers of staff. 2. Efforts need to be made to make the post of care co-ordinator more attractive. The evidence heard that the pay within North East London Foundation Trust is not comparable to other Trusts. 3. Care Co-ordinators within the Trust are currently carrying excessive caseloads. 4. There has been an increase in the number of referrals coming into the service.

Evidence was given at the inquest that at the time of Dean\u2019s passing, there were issues accessing second (s.12) doctors out of office hours for the purpose of carrying out a MHA assessment, resulting in delays to MHA assessments being carried out. The EDT explained that since Dean\u2019s passing, a \u201cs.12 Solutions\u201d App has been introduced, and although this had made a significant improvement, issues still exist trying to access a second doctor out of hours, as the EDT is still wholly reliant on second doctors making themselves available after midnight (with no fixed rota). 2. Evidence was given at the inquest that at the time of Dean\u2019s passing, there were issues securing the timely attendance of the private ambulance service (ERS Medical) to transport patients after a MHA assessment had taken place, potentially resulting in an increased risk to both the AMHP and the patient for MHA assessments in the community. The EDT advised that since Dean\u2019s passing, despite spot purchasing of private ambulances being introduced, issues still exist trying to get the private ambulance to attend a MHA assessment in a timely manner. 3.

was diagnosed at age 16 years as being autistic by CAMHS with a designation of Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. Her medical records recorded that. 2 In or about 2010, Zoe was wrongly attributed by the Mental Health Service, TEWV, clinicians who knew of her autism -as undergoing Emotional Dysregulation Disorder when in fact she was experiencing a meltdown common in autistic individuals.onally Unstable Personality - Disorder (\u201cEUPD\u2019} 3 That attribution was not formally diagnosed, and not discussed with Zoe who found out by chance when looking at her records. She continued to be regarded and treated as if she was experiencing that condition and clinicians would not adapt to her distress caused by that attribution. There was inertia and excessive delay (to May 2020) in removing reference to EUPD which had been discounted in October 2018 all of which added to her distress. These actions and inactions destroyed her relationship with community mental health clinicians and she did not trust them enough to try to restore any effective care relationship. 4 She suffered repeated trauma derived from her autistic condition revisiting the causes of her distress which she re-experienced time and again with \u2018film reel\u2019 recollection. That trauma was again not understood. 5 In short, her autism (and thus risk assessment) was misunderstood by the clinicians tasked to keep her safe. 6 TEWVs provision for cares of autistic conditions were underdeveloped, reflecting national want of provision, to include:\u00ad A no multidisciplinary clinical assessment and formulation addressed her autism; B no reasonable adjustments were then made in terms of her sensory and environmental needs in any timely fashion, or at all; C no person centred (thus autism centred) holistic plan was developed to work in partnership with Zoe that took account of her autism, and her gender. As the evidence revealed one \u201ccannot uncouple autism and other psychological\/psychiatric experiences\u201d. Instead, she withdrew from engagement with TEWV community health clinicians. D there was no local provision within TEWV for specialist autism assessment and adapted psychological therapy. Commissioned providers of these essential cares were outwith TEWV, requiring specific Funding Request (which was granted) for a course of assessment and therapy. Those providers did not offer statutory acute mental health services support, including out of hours\/crisis support. TEWV did not provide what the commissioned providers were supplying. There was a want of effective communications between these \u2018teams\u2019 not least as patient data was not accessible by one to the others electronic records (patient consent permitting) and the fact of disengagement. There was a sense of \u2018silo\u2019 working, militating against partnership working, that encouraged unfavourably the undesirable \u201cuncoupling\u2019 of experiences; E statistical evidence indicated that autistic individuals are more at risk of suicide than those with no neurodevelopmental condition, and females at greater risk that their male counterparts; 2 OFFICIAL SENSITIVE F there was a clinical (but not measured) experience that more patients were presenting to the statutory service with autistic conditions and, it follows, more patients would be at risk of suicide; G from 2016 to her death, Zoe was detained under ss 2\/3 MHA 1983 17 times and presented to A and E around 37 times with evident self harm and apparent attempts on her life. She repeated high risk behaviours, She had no Care Co-ordinator nor effective Care Plan (which ought to have been in place) because she had not engaged with TEWV community services; H Zoe lurched form crisis to crisis remaining at high risk to her own safety; she died because she could no longer cope with the sense of injustice caused by others that overwhelmed her thinking. She felt she was not being listened to by community mental health services. Her therapy from outside providers which was proving helpful to her was disrupted by COVID-19 limitations on face - to face consultations; - Both locally, including regional, but also nationally the evidence revealed a number of serious issues that require urgent and immediate action to support autistic people well, not just from a sensory and environmental basis (which TEWV have started to improve albeit from a low baseline according to the evidence received).

It was clear from the evidence that the product was made to reduce the risk of self harm and could not eliminate the risk and that wearers still required supervision. However, in practice it may have provided some reassurance to staff that could not be made from the clothing. (2) Evidence was heard that Emma had sadly somehow managed to use components of her anti clothing to form a ligature to end her life. (3) The evidence given at the inquest was clear that since the notification of Emma\u2019s death your company have gone to considerable efforts and are to be commended in relation to the changes you have made to your product to further reduce the risk of the products being used to self harm. (4) Further evidence was given that some of the products like those Emma wore are still in circulation and whilst Cygnet are aware and possibly NHS Providers via Cygnet reporting the issue to them there remain risks that users of those products may use them in the same way. This risk may be increased following the publication of the circumstances of Emma\u2019s death.

was given that: 1. James had accessed a forum on the internet known to promote suicide. That website and the forum discussions attached to it provided advice and guidance on: (i) Appropriate drugs\/medication which would produce a terminal result; (ii) Which drugs were most effective; (iii) How they should be taken.; (iv) How they could be purchased;. (v) End of life planning. 2. James was careful and methodical in the actions he took to end his life. He appeared to follow some guidance on the steps to take from a \u201chandbook\u201d which the family believe was generated from a suicide promoting website and his decision to acquire the pentobarbital medication was informed by the that website. 3. The suicide promoting website appeared to act as a trigger in his decision to take his own life. I am concerned that: 3 (a) There are websites and forums which openly promote and advertise methods of suicide which are easily accessible; (b) Suicide is the largest cause of death for individuals in the UK under the age of 35 and James Forryan is within that age bracket; (c) There does not appear to be sufficient regulation or enforcement action against such websites which promote criminal

relatively small quantities of can easily be purchased (2) a. is currently a \u201creportable substance\u201d or \u201creportable poison\u201d under Part 4 of Schedule 1 to the Poisons Act 1972. As a result, under certain circumstances, sellers are under an obligation to report suspicious transactions, disappearances, and thefts of the substance, in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of State (s.3C Poisons Act 1972). b. However, this is a much less rigorous degree of control than is exercised over \u201cregulated poisons\u201d under the terms of the legislation. Those substances, which are listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1 of the Act, are subject to requirements including licensing, record-keeping of sales, and other restrictions in relation to the general public. Coroner's Court, 2 Faraday Court, Faraday Drive, Fulwood, Preston, Lancashire, PR2 9NB | Fax 01772 530752 c. Both the regulated poisons and reportable poison lists can specify \u201cconcentration limits\u201d which restrict the obligations imposed by the legislation to chemicals in concentrations at or above that limit. For example, ammonia is \u201creportable\u201d in concentrations at or above 10% weight in weight (w\/w) and phenols are \u201cregulated\u201d at or above 60% w\/w. The power to specify a concentration can ensure that low concentrations of substances are not subject to the regime but higher (and therefore more dangerous levels) are subject to scrutiny.

I heard evidence from the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd that training on dealing with vulnerable persons was not mandatory for frontline staff. In fact only 583 out of 7,500 staff had attended a course run by the Samaritans entitled Managing Suicidal Contacts, 40% had completed some e-learning and an unknown number had completed an internal course. In addition refresher training on this issue was an aspiration only and had not been rolled out by Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd. I also heard evidence that the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd did not have any input into the training for their team based in the joint control room. I am therefore concerned that those members of staff most likely to have contact with vulnerable or suicidal persons, as well as those responsible for assisting frontline staff, are not all properly trained to deal with the situation in the best possible way. (2) I heard evidence that Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd staff control room staff relied upon a protocol entitled \u2018Person ill on a train\u2019 when a vulnerable person was reported to them. The witness responsible for the Govia Thameslink Railway control room team accepted that this was not an appropriate document to rely upon as it made no mention of vulnerable persons. I am therefore concerned that the control room staff do not have the appropriate information to assist their colleagues and to arrange an appropriate response when a \u2018concern for welfare\u2019 report is made to them. (3) I heard evidence that the Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not log all actions taken after the concern for welfare report. I am concerned that it is not possible to assess whether all reasonable and appropriate actions were taken by the control room staff and whether individuals or teams have further training needs.  (4) The Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not contact British Transport Police, 999 nor share the information about this \u2018concern for welfare\u2019 report with Network Rail despite having a joint control room. I heard evidence that there was no written protocol covering when Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd staff should share a \u2018concern for welfare\u2019 report with Network Rail staff in the shared control room.

Evidence was heard of a historic culture of bullying and harassment within the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team which has led to a loss of compassion in some instances with the view that some suicides are \u201cinevitable\u201d and some reluctance to recognise when cases should be referred to the Team. Work has been undertakenen by the Trust to improve such cultural attitudes. However, it was recognised in evidence that there is \u201cstill a distance to go\u201d and areas where the culture needs to change. It is of concern that this culture remains three years following Theo\u2019s death 2. Following an Assessment, a person is still discharged from the Community Team without any immediate \u201ccheck\u201d or discussion as to the correctness of this decision. It was heard that following Theo\u2019s death immediate discharge from the Community Team following assessment is relatively rare. In these circumstances, such a discussion would not place an onerous burden on the Team and would enable a review of the discharging decision to be undertaken to ensure it is the correct decision. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 08 April 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: parents via their solicitor. University of East Anglia. I am also under a duty to send a copy of your response to the Chief Coroner and all interested persons who in my opinion should receive it.

McManus had complex mental health and social care needs. He was in contact with a significant number of agencies many of which focused on the risk that Matthew posed to others. However, the evidence before me, particularly that of the Salford Safeguarding Board indicates that no -one saw Matthew as the vulnerable adult he was and addressed how his own complex needs were to be met, either through a Care act assessment or any other means. , on behalf of the Safeguarding Board who conducted a Safeguarding Adult Review told the Inquest that there was no one person or agency co-ordinating his support and care, meaning that Matthew did not have a single point of contact to help him understand and navigate the services being offered to him. This became particularly concerning when Matthew\u2019s mental health declined, making him more erratic and difficult to contact. This left already stretched services to do what they could to pull information together from their own resources or conversations with other agencies. Without proper co-ordination, there was no full information sharing, joint assessment, or joint planning of Matthew\u2019s support, which meant there was never a full appreciation of the risk he posed to himself, and no real care plan was in place to manage that risk. Without a clear pathway for agencies to jointly assess and co-ordinate care in the case of adults with complex mental health and social care needs, I am concerned that future deaths will occur.

On 6 September 2017 the deceased telephoned his GP who prescribed him Zopiclone, Venlafaxine and Propanolol. 2. On 26 September 2017 the deceased saw Dr A. Dr A decided to change his medication and prescribed him Duloxetine and Zolpidem. 3. On 5 October 2017 the deceased saw Dr A again. The Zolpidem was swapped to Nitrazepam, a more potent sedative, as the deceased had said that after 2 weeks he had not found the\u0616 effective. Expert evidence adduced at the inquest from___. was to the effect that the deceased's presentation at this\u0617d have triggered a further inquiry into his psychiatric history ...... said that he would have contacted the deceased's home GP. 4. On ' 1 9 October 2017 the deceased saw Dr A again. He said he was feeling better on the Duloxetine but was still stressed and anxious and got a few anxiety attacks. Dr A prescribed him Propanol, Nitrazepam and Xanax. Dr A also prescribed the deceased 6 months' worth of Duloxetine. - - evidence was that it was \"most unusuaf' to prescribe such a large amount of medication (6 months' worth of Duloxetine) during the initial period where a patient's medication had been switched and where close monitoring was needed. He opined that the first 6 weeks of the 'switch' period were ones in which the patien mi ht et better, might get worse and might develop suicidal thoughts. - said that such a volume of medication was not merited clinica y an cou d create a risk of overdose. 5. On 8 and 9 November 2017 the deceased saw Dr B. She made no notes of his presentation or diagnosis on any occasion when she saw him which she accepted she should have done. She \u0618t note her rationale for changing his medication which again ..... said should have happened. He also considered that Dr B should have examined the past records for the deceased which she accepted she had not done in full. 6. There are a series of further issues with the medication Dr B prescribed the deceased and her records of the same. The electronic patient notes reflect a prescription for Xanax but she said in evidence that the deceased had not in fact accepted this. She prescribed him Temazepam but this is a controlled drug in this country and cannot be prescribed in the usual way. She changed this to Nitrazepam but the dose was incorrect and this was refused by the pharmacy. The next day she prescribed him Lorazepam without him returning the Nitrazepam prescription to her. She made an error in the dose for Lorazepam and had to correct that. When he attended on 15 November 2017 asking for more medication she made no note of his attendance. 7 ....... evidence was that the multiple changes to the medication \"regiriie\"'iie by Dr B were not medically indicated and that the deceased clearly needed an urgent psychiatric referral. He said this was the case by 8 November 2017. 8. Overall - said his impression was that Dr B did not understand what she was prescribing. 9. I accepted opinion on the various issues set out above. 2 10. Large numbers of boxes of medication were found at the deceased's flat after his death by the police and his family.

Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation View the full list hereals to child mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I have been told that the triaging process is now undertaken by an \u201cAccess and Advice Team\u201d but I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 2 The evidence at the inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child mental health services over many years, Oskar Nash never received the clinical assessment he needed. I have been told that the system now in place ought to result in a child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical team. I am satisfied that the introduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of the new Mindworks service, is intended to ensure that a referred child\u2019s needs are properly identified and met. However, on the basis of the evidence I heard at the prevention of future deaths hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring its pupils, I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that some referrals may be inappropriately closed (for example because the child, at an early stage, declines to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this context, I am concerned that there is a lack of specific monitoring of what proportion of referred children reach a clinical team and the extent to which the outcomes match the expectations of the referrers (so that any ongoing \u201cbarriers\u201d in the system, which may be preventing proper access to the clinical teams, can then be identified and eliminated). Concern 3 The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is triaged initially as being crisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria for crisis, urgent and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority of referrals are categorised as routine. I have been told that the routine referrals are automatically categorised as \u201clow risk\u201d. I am concerned about this as it is clear from the evidence that a child may not meet the criteria crisis, urgent or priority but, like Oskar Nash, may nevertheless be at a high or medium risk of harm. The Trust is currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there is a considerable waiting time for its \u201croutine\u201d cases to be addressed. It seems inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been wrongly assumed to be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged. Concern 4 I was told that the Standard Operating Procedure manual for the triage of referrals to children\u2019s mental health services is to be updated to reflect the Trust\u2019s new working practices but that this has not yet been done. I am concerned that important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a referred child\u2019s records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the child\/family are spoken to) are not yet established in written guidance. Concern 5 The evidence at the inquest showed that the clinicians who were responsible for ensuring that Oskar Nash\u2019s medical conditions, including his risk of self-harm and suicide, and his consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in his Education, Health and Care Plan, failed to do so; this was in part because they did not fully understand their role and obligations in this regard. On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of future deaths hearing, I am concerned that there continues to be a lack of understanding amongst the clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to their role in that process. I am further concerned that there is in place no programme for the training or monitoring of these clinicians in relation to these responsibilities. B. Surrey County Council (and National) (i) Education and Special Educational Needs Department Concern 6 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in the Education \/ SEN Department, including SEN caseworkers, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 7 The evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before his death, Oskar Nash was moved from a special needs school and placed into a mainstream school which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex needs. I found that the inappropriate placement, by SCC, of Oskar into the mainstream school contributed to his death. Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with Oskar\u2019s Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this failed adequately to identify and record his mental and emotional health concerns, his risk of suicidal ideation, his consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and it had not been updated to reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which he was being moved. I was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by his special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet his needs and informed the SEN Department accordingly. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the case that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department with the child\u2019s EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there is a lack of clarity as to the extent to which a current school may or should provide records or information to a prospective school. I am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and record sharing. On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the case), it is unlikely to contain all matters of relevance to the question of a prospective school\u2019s ability to meet the child\u2019s needs. I was given no good reason why fuller information and record sharing, sufficient to ensure that the prospective school can properly assess its ability to meet the child\u2019s needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a new school. I am concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally, to ensure this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools\u2019 powers and duties to share information and documents, and any data protection ramifications this may have. (ii) Children\u2019s Services Department Concern 8 The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff in SCC\u2019s Children\u2019s Services Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. I am concerned that there continues to be no requirement for the staff to undertake relevant Autism training on a mandatory basis. Concern 9 At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nash\u2019s final referral to SCC\u2019s Children\u2019s Services Department, which was made approximately two months before his death, there was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of his situation and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate his case appropriately. I found that this contributed to his death. The inappropriate allocation resulted, in part, from the application of SCC\u2019s then \u201cthreshold of needs\u201d document, which was used to inform the level at which support should be provided. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about SCC\u2019s revised \u201cthreshold of needs\u201d document, as well as the recent guidance (including a \u201ctoolbox\u201d) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced since Oskar\u2019s death. Despite these changes, I remain concerned that the \u201cthreshold of needs\u201d document does not adequately and clearly reflect the known risks of mental health difficulties, self-harm, and suicidal ideation for autistic children (given their prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentially, there is an ongoing risk that an autistic child in these circumstances will be allocated an insufficient level of support, as was the case for Oskar. C. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical Commissioning Group (and National) Concern 10 At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence concerning the post- death reviews conducted into Oskar Nash\u2019s death by the Surrey Child Death Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership. The evidence showed that neither process resulted in a sufficient or effective investigation of the death; I consider that the evidence shows that fact finding was superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory agencies in the causation of his death, and only very limited learning was identified. Ineffective review by the child death review processes results in the risk of further deaths in similar circumstances and I am concerned that the local and\/or national process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post- death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest process, is achieved in all cases. D. National Issues Concern 11 From the evidence I heard at the inquest and the prevention of future deaths hearing, it was apparent that the national \u201cWorking Together\u201d guidance focuses on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or from other parental failures to keep the child safe. It was apparent that the consequential approach tends to look critically at the child\u2019s family and parent(s) and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child is in need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the approach of agencies to Oskar and his family. I am concerned that \u201cWorking Together\u201d does not provide clearer guidance specifically for the safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism, and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families. Concern 12 The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self- harm and suicidal ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. There was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which I heard. At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence of more training being available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and mandatory training. I was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to all state agencies working directly with autistic adults and children.

the inquest it became apparent that a certain number of prisoners in HMP Wormwood Scrubs were detained for deportation reasons after the conclusion of their prison sentence. There seemed to be a marked disparity between the information and advice available to a detained prisoner, compared with a free individual or one in a deportation centre. There was a paucity of available information and the letters sent out by the Home Office were written in legal English with no offer of translation or \u201cplain English\u201d assistance. Individuals in the community could access the internet, Law centres, citizens advice or any other sources of assistance that were not available to detained prisoners due to the restrictive regime, putting them at a disadvantage. Communication between the prison officers and home office officials and immigration staff was ineffective and frequently not evidenced at all. Pieces of paper were lost, phones were unanswered with no answer phone facility, email addresses were unavailable due to incompatible systems and there was no audit trail of attempted communications or the reason why these were unsuccessful. Many requests made by or on behalf of the prisoner were not dealt with in a timely manner or at all.

option for applicants to disclose a mental health illness should be considered separate to them confirming whether they have any \u2018discovery\u2019 or \u2018reactive responses\u2019. It is likely that the majority of applicants will consider evidence of a disability or special needs to refer to physical illness, not mental health illness. Moreover, those who suffer from mental health illness (irrespective of its severity) will often not consider themselves to have a \u2018disability\u2019.

it became apparent that the result of Mr Busby's MRI scan had not been reviewed by a clinician, a consultant employed by North Cumbia Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust ('the Trust') undertook an investigation. He noted that the Trust use EMIS as an electronic patient record. He explained that the Trust used a separate system called ICE to gather the results of tests or scans. ICE is capable of linking to EMIS to input results into the EMIS system. Once a test result has been linked to a patient in EMIS the result enters the EMIS record as a provisional result pending review, and is placed on a work list. The consultant or a deputy then reviews the result, files it with or without comment and records any actions taken. EMIS provides two options: 'file no comment' and 'file and comment'. Results of blood tests which are undertaken to monitor treatment and which are normal may be filed without comment. If there is an abnormality flagged, however, EMIS will default to the file with comment dialogue box even if file no comment is selected. This acts as a safeguard against missing a significant finding. Unfortunately, there is no flag attached in the ICE system for abnormal radiology results, and so no failsafe exists for defaulting to a 'file and comment' if a significant positive or negative finding is reported. In the course of investigating what occurred in relation to Mr Busby's MRI scan, it was determined that clicking more than once on the 'file no comment' button will result in the displayed result being filed, but will also result in filing of the next in the list if that result has no flag indicating the result is abnormal. Thus if a radiology result lies below a normal blood result and a clinician inadvertently double clicks to file the first result, the radiology result is also filed without comment and without the result being displayed. Furthermore, multiple clicks up to 6 (and perhaps even beyond) will lead to multiple filings. In the result it is possible that a clinician inadvertently clicking 'file no comment' more than once on one result would cause results which require urgent follow up being filed without a clinician being involved. I am concerned that this might lead to lost opportunities to treat patients whose scans reveal, for instance, early malignancies. It might also mean that scans which reveal the need for urgent action will be overlooked. I am therefore concerned that future deaths will occur. I was impressed by the candour of the report provided to me and the efforts that the Trust have already taken to resolve this issue. However I noted that the evidence I received was that \"In order to fix this issue it is likely it will require action by the publishers of EMIS to prevent accidental filing of results. To attempt to mitigate this issue whilst a permanent fix is sought I have worked with colleagues from Pathology and Radiology to attempt to have all radiology results (where the greatest risk lies) flagged within the ICE system as abnormal, so that any attempt to file the result prompts via the file and comment dialogue box. Unfortunately at the time of writing this letter the flag, which is triggered in ICE for any radiology report originating within Cumbria Neuroscience, does not carry through to EMIS 9 and we continue to seek a local solution to mitigate this newly identified risk.\" In the circumstances I have concluded that it is necessary for action to be taken to prevent future deaths. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN 6 In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (1) North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust and (2) EMIS Group have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, 7 namely by 11th March 2022 I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: 8 I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest.

The management of medication prescribed to prisoners. At post mortem examination the toxicologist determined that there were a number of drugs in Ian's blood and urine that he had not been prescribed. The court was informed that at HMP Usk, all prisoners are required to be capable of managing their own medication. The medications are not kept in a locked facility. The evidence provided clearly indicated that prisoners were trading prescribed medication which had become a form of currency within the prison. Ian's former cellmate indicated this practice was rife and indeed Ian bought medication from other prisoners. Evidence was heard from the Governor \/ Head of Safety at HMP Usk who informed the court that he was not aware of this practice, and it appears this was also not known by the prison officers. The court was informed that there is a system of randomised checks in place within the prison to attempt to determine whether prisoners are appropriately managing their medication, however prisoners have clearly found ways around this.

During the inquest there was evidence that Working with Risk (WWR) documentation was not completed on approximately the first nine contacts with Mr Hammond. The 1st contact was on 23rd December 2020 where 2 hours had been allocated for this task as well as the initial assessment and care plan \u2013 none of the written documents were completed. The WWR documents were also not completed (on subsequent contacts) on 31\/12\/20, 3\/01\/21, 4\/01\/21,5\/01\/21, 6\/01\/21, 7\/01\/21, 8\/01\/21, 10\/01\/21 and 11\/01\/21. The Trust was unable to give an explanation for these failures. As a result, the care plan for Mr Hammond was unsatisfactory. 6.

I heard evidence that the Department of Education have devolved responsibility for e-security systems with schools having to \u2018tender\u2019 for web filtering software and hardware. However, the guidelines issued by the Department of Education require updating and are insufficiently robust to ensure their effectiveness and meet the changing demands of e-security in schools. 2. There is a wide range of software vendors providing different lists of blocklists with different vendors enabling different categories with no oversight or regulatory chguidance by the Department of Education as to what \u2018blocklists\u2019 are either acceptable and\/or suitable for a school environment. 3. is not a specifically blocked and not only can it be accessed by Key Stage 4 students there is encouragement to do so in some schools. However, I heard evidence that the sites Frankie accessed through . Furthermore, there is inadequate independent scrutiny by to remove age inappropriate stories put on their platform. 4. Some websites are only blocked when there is a particular key word in the URL If the relevant trigger word (e.g. ) is not there it makes it difficult for the filter to \u2018see\u2019 the content of the website to be able to block it, hence why stories on could be read. However, there are software systems available that acts as a \u2018key logger\u2019 and \u2018screen reader\u2019. Whilst this will not block the site it will generate a report to the nominated safeguarding individual for further action. Yet it has not been considered or is part of the guidelines issued by the Department of Education 5. In summary, on the evidence I heard there appears to be inadequate regulatory oversight with now outdated guidance issued by the Department of Education with regard to robust standards of e-security

During the inquest evidence was heard that: i. The medical care provided to service personnel through the DCMH is not truly independent, in that personal medical information may be disclosed to Chain of Command where substantial public learnrestdisclosure, particularly for the protectionistmental health care provided in a civilian context. The evidence heard at the Inquest was that this lack of independence risks service personnel minimising or under reporting mental health symptoms, including thoughts, intent and plans, for fear this would be disclosed to the Chain of Command. ii. Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings are held every 2 weeks at RM Poole, where service personnel who are under the care of the DCMH and\/or Welfare Team are discussed. There is also the option for individual Case Conferences to be called on an ad hoe basis to discuss an individual service user if the need arises. Attendees at these meetings include the RSM and\/or the Adjutant, DCMH and the Welfare Team. The evidence I heard is that although Welfare Officers are trained to assess the risk a service user may pose to him or herself, in the MDT\/Case Conference setting the assessment as to the nature of the risk an individual service user poses, and therefore the risk plan that is formulated to mitigate those risks, is determined only by the view taken by the DCMH. Where a service user may be providing different information to DCMH and Welfare, the true extent of the risk a service user poses to him or herself may not be adequately addressed in the formulation of the risk management plan. iii. There is no single composite risk assessment and care plan for service users that draws tooether all the relevant information for 2 6 7 8 a service user and identifies the plan in place (care plan and risk management plan) at any given time. Such as document is often used in other care settings, including mental health trusts. 2. I have concerns with regard to the following: i. The lack of independence of DCMH risks service users minimising and\/or under reporting the risks they may pose to themselves for fear that information may be disclosed to the Chain of Command. If the true extent of the risk of is not known by DCMH, an effective risk management plan to mitigate the risk of cannot be formulated. ii. The primacy of the view of DCMH when considering the risk of in MDT\/Case Conferences again means that the true risk of may not be accounted for, particularly where a service user is providing different information to DCMH and Welfare and\/or where there is a disagreement between DCMH and Welfare as to the presenting level of risk. Adopting a process similar to a Multi-Agency Risk Management Meeting f'MARM'1 or Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conference (\"MARAC'1 in a civilian context may assist: in a MARM or MARAC, the level of risk adopted is the highest level raised in the meeting\/conference, without any agency having primacy. Therefore, the risk management plan subsequently formulated addresses the highest level of risk brought to the meeting. iii. Where there is no composite risk assessment and care plan document that draws together all the relevant information for a patient and identifies the plan in place at any given time, there is a risk that key information and risk factors are missed, which is less likely if there is a composite document in addition to the clinical records.

report relates to two inquests. They were held jointly after I acceded to a request from the bereaved family that the inquests be conducted together. As will have been noted from section 4 above, both Marshall Metcalfe and his Mother, Jane Ireland, were known to mental health services. The concern I wish to raise emanated from Marshall's death. He had been admitted to a mental health facility in February 2019 and remained there until he was discharged on 06\/01\/20 to his Mother's home where he resided until his death on 07\/05\/20. One month later, his Mother Jane died at her home on 07\/06\/2020. The court heard that when Marshall was in the mental health facility during what was his 2nd admission, a decision was made to discharge him from children's social care. He had been supported as a Child in Need [under section 17, Children Act 1989] for 28 months, and this continued for a large part of that admission until 14\/10\/19. In September 2019, a decision had been taken by Children's Social Care to cease their involvement as no role could be identified for a statutory social worker at that time. Any home leave had been suspended indefinitely, and there were no definite plans for Marshall to be discharged. However, a request was made that in the event the decision about home leave were to change, or if discharge was to be considered likely for Marshall, then Children's Social Care would again have a role and a re\u00ad referral should be made. In fact, Marshall was discharged on 06\/01\/20, there being no evidence before the court that such a re-referral had in fact been received by Children's Social Care by then and it follows there had been no social worker input into Marshall's discharge planning. At the inquest, the court received evidence [from Marshall's Responsible Clinician, Consultant Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist, Dr ] that in his experience when patients are admitted to the facility Children's Social Care will close their case for the patient, and that when the patient is later ready for discharge a re-referral becomes necessary. He also reminded the court that throughout a patient's admission, consideration is being given to discharge in line with the recommendation of NHS England that all admissions should be kept as short as possible and the expectation that there should be discussion about discharge at every Care Programme Approach (CPA) meeting. Another witness, , a former Inpatient Social Worker at the facility with 25 years of experience as an Approved Mental Health Professional, told the court that in his view when such a re-referral does become necessary it is like \"starting from scratch\" and causes immense problems building trusting therapeutic relationships with young people. He felt that there should be continual input from social care during the patient's admission, and that in the event that there has been no social worker input into a patient's discharge this raises the risk for that person once they leave the facility. I also instructed Dr , a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, to provide an independent expert opinion on the care provided to Marshall. In her evidence she shared the concerns of Dr and and described this as \"a wider issue\" that was not confined to this case. The issue that I raise is as follows: I share concern, echoed by Dr , and ideally social care not closing their case, but remaining involved throughout a patient's admission would be helpful. It may be that they would play a minor role, if any, whilst the patient remains in hospital until discharge is felt to be a genuine prospect, but once their input does become necessary they would be more able to respond quickly and to actively participate in discharge planning without the need to wait for the re-referral process to be carried out, thereby ensuring that the effectiveness of role played by social care in discharge planning is not compromised . In Marshall's case, I found that there was no evidence that shortcomings in relation to discharge had materially contributed to his death, but I feel that this issue does pose a risk of deaths in the future, and that it is my duty to write this report. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN 6 7 8 9 In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Friday 21st January 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: \u2022 [Sister of Marshall\/ Daughter of Jane]; \u2022 Lancashire & South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust; \u2022 Lancashire County Council; \u2022 Blackpool Clinical Commission Group\/ Fylde & Wyre Clinical Commissioning Group I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete, redacted, or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 25\/11\/2021 Signature__________ _ Alan

Consideration should be given to identifying key risk factors, and how (in very practical terms) that information can be used to reduce suicide risk. 3. Consideration should be given to regular review of individual soldiers, to screen their mental as well as physical health. It may be that that would be something which would sit better outside of their chain of command. 4. Consideration should be given to increasing awareness of how to handle service complaints within the army.

The sharing of examination results and how examinations are marked is complex, confusing and at times capable of appearing misleading. Mared had failed one Professional Skills Assessment during the second year of her degree (2019\/2020) and had undertaken a resit during the first semester for which she had received a \u2018provisional pass\u2019. This was not ratified in the June exam board; instead it was to be ratified in the September exam board round in accordance with the University\u2019s policy (though that was not obviously clear at the time). The indication therefore to Mared in July 2020 was that she had not successfully completed the year. The result was later ratified in September. Furthermore, marks of 39% and 1% (fails) for assessments are given in situations where marks could be \u2018pending\u2019. (2) There is no system in place for personal tutors to contact students ahead of the release of failed examination results, especially in vulnerable students. Students are not contacted directly by telephone by their personal tutors ahead of the release of the results in the event of failed modules or in the event of being informed that they had not successfully completed the year despite the complex and confusing assessment and results process and potentially misleading process around the sharing of examination results.

Evidence given at the inquest by the ED Consultant indicated that it has been recognised that the accelerated administration of N-Acetylcysteine may be beneficial in the treatment of a but this has not yet been adopted into a Standard Operating Protocol despite this having been proposed in August 2021 2. Following the issue of a regulation 28 report on the 14th of July 2021 in connection with the inquest touching upon the death of Rhian Roberts in similar circumstances, the response from BCUHB indicated by way of a letter dated the 7th of September 2021 that procedures to mitigate risks due to failure to act on diagnostic results would be approved and active by the 1st of October 2021, however at the time of concluding the inquest of Kyle Hurst on the 22nd of October, this had not been accomplished. 3. I am concerned that the Health Board continue to fail to achieve changes in a timely manner, even in circumstances where they have set their own timeframe and that as a result of this lives are being put at risk.

Mr Franks had a known history of self-harming and suicide attempts. His emotional state when seen at court on 11 April 2019 was triggered at least in part to his reaction to a development in the prosecution brought against him which he had not foreseen. His statement that he was likely to commit suicide was not communicated to either the security staff at the court or the prison staff. In consequence, the prison staff had no information concerning the events which took place at court. (2) Mr Franks somehow perceived that he had been sentenced to five years imprisonment, which was not the case. This false impression caused him to be in distress prior to being locked in his cell around 19:00 hours. (3) Had information concerning his emotions at court been relayed to the prison staff, this may have triggered a decision to open an ACCT - the process by which a Prisoner is subject to increased monitorinq and suooort. In the event no 1 checks were made on him for some 10 hours. (4) At a previous hearing on 25.02.17 Mr Franks had made a comparable threat to kill himself as a result of what he perceived to be an adverse development in the case brought against him. At that time his signed consent authorising information to be passed to the prison was obtained and communicated to the prison. (5) The benefit of relaying helpful information to the prison intended to protect Mr Franks, does not seem to involve a breach of professional privilege.

the inquest evidence was heard about the differences in the way CAMHS Hospitals and Adult mental Health Hospitals approached the care of the patients on their wards. When hearing evidence during the inquest it was established that when a child turned 18, and was a patient on a Mental health ward, once transferred to an adult Mental Health Hospital they would immediately be treated in accordance with the adult provisions. It was accepted that there is no provision there is currently no one in-patient provision for people between the ages of 14-25. It was also accepted that simply because a child becomes 18 does not mean that they are an adult. The lack of this provision in a mental health in-patient setting leads me to conclude that there is a risk of further deaths

Mary was referred to the mental health team in November 2019 and was assessed in January 2020, some three weeks later than should have been. 2. There was a delay in Mary receiving psychological therapy. She was still on the waiting list at the time of her death. 3. The evidence was that at the date of inquest, there continued to be a delay in service users receiving psychological therapy. Evidence was heard that balancing capacity and demand, which has increased, remains a challenge. The cases referred are of increasing complexity, as in Mary\u2019s case 4. Some steps have been taken in an effort to deal with this, such as specific risk assessment training, focusing on intervention treatment plans to aid capacity and throughput, reviewing the skill mix of staff 5. However, there is the ongoing issue of recruitment and retention of suitably skilled staff by the Trust and the ability to resource this to enable the Trust to function effectively 6.

4 a.The transfer and communication process from the HBTT to the CMHT in 2019 and 2020 was unsatisfactory with inadequate follow up as required. The court has received evidence about similar problems in other inquests in which GMMH was the treating NHS Trust and is a repeated issue of concern. b. There was lack of appropriate escalation following the deceased\u2019s disengagement with community services in 2019 but also in 2020 when there was a repeated lack of direct contact with him as well as the recognition of its importance. From June 2020 no other methods were tried to have direct contact with the deceased apart from attempts from phone calls which were repeatedly unsuccessful. c. There was no consideration of referral back to the HBTT by the CMHT when the deceased may have benefited from it when circumstances changed. There was disengagement from services after the end of February 2020 as well as evidence of noncompliance with medication. d. There was no GMMH procedure or process to check regularly if the deceased was being prescribed the correct medication and it being collected. In addition his response to it. e. The GP practice failed to ensure that medication (for a patient with a serious mental health problem with a history of suicidal ideas, plans and previous attempts) was prescribed. This is despite them receiving letters from GMMH clinicians requesting this. Consequently, the deceased did not receive the therapeutic benefit the medication would have provided. f. The GP system for recording receipt of correspondence and ensuring that they were seen and reviewed by a GP was inadequate. As was communication with and from the Pharmacy team. Nor was there consideration of a system or process for contacting the secondary care provider GMMH in such circumstances when medication was not prescribed as requested and no contact could be made with the deceased. There was no escalation process\/procedure. g. There was no CMHT\/HBTT planned involvement with the GP in the overall management and treatment of the deceased apart from simply requesting that they issue repeat prescriptions. This meant that opportunities to develop other lines of communication and information sharing as well as support were lost. h. The CMHT Responsible Clinician was an important witness but the GMMH SUI investigation did not obtain a statement from him and the those carrying out the investigation failed to recognise the significance of this. Nor was this identified in the overview of the report before it was signed off. This meant the all the lessons for future care and planning were not learnt.

taken at the Inquest indicated Ms Tolley had been admitted to the Becklin Centre late on the night of 18 October 2019 and was Sectioned on 24 October. She was categorised as at \u2018high risk\u2019 and deemed to require 1:1 continuous observations, within eyesight, without bathroom privacy. In the days preceding her death 7 incidents occurred, culminating in one around 13.00 hours on Sunday 27 October. At approximately 13.50 hours the same afternoon she absconded whilst being permitted to walk in the hospital grounds with an escort. Approximately one hour later she was found with a that resulted in un-survivable injuries and died the following day. 2 1. The Care Plan agreed between Ms Tolley and the team treating her, included a provision that in the event she absconded, she would neither be restrained, nor followed. Given her history and risk profile, it appeared this contingent instruction to staff regarding the risk of absconding, placed too much emphasis on her long term ability to manage her own turbulent emotions, at the expense of the imperative of keeping her safe. The priorities underlying such instructions merit further review. 2. The absconding instructions to staff (set out above) seems incompatible with the duty to detain in order to keep safe, inherent in an order under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 when viewed in the context of a patient deemed to require such intensive monitoring. 3. The decision to permit ground leave so shortly after a incident (and only three days after a previous absconding incident) was made on a relatively informal basis. There were no documented criteria to be considered before it was approved, nor was the grade of staff required to make the decision stipulated. 4. The instruction to staff stipulated \u2018physical interventions\u2019 will not be used to restrain Ms Tolley, yet this expression was not defined or particularised. Greater clarity might assist a staff escort (likely to be a relatively junior individual) to know whether it was permissible, for example, to put a gentle hand on Ms Tolley\u2019s shoulder to steer her back towards the hospital. 5. The permission given to walk in the grounds of the hospital was not considered to amount to section 17 MHA 1983 leave. The informality involved in the decision missed an opportunity to consider issues such as: (a) Whether two escorts would be appropriate in view of Ms Tolley having absconded three days earlier. This would have facilitated one person following her to monitor and report on her whereabouts. In a time critical situation this could have altered the tragic outcome; (b) Providing the escort with a discretion in the manner of a dynamic risk assessment whether or not to follow Ms Tolley. (c) Reviewing the type of applied to her wounds, before she was permitted to leave the ward, in the light of her misuse of these . 6. The care plan containing the staff instruction not to restrain or follow was discussed and agreed with Ms Tolley. She was thus expressly aware that if she did decide to abscond, she knew she would be able to do so. Moreover, she was explicitly told that the staff member escorting her would return to the reception area and wait for a short period in the hope Ms Tolley would return voluntarily. The implication of this was that Ms Tolley knew she had a period of grace of around 10 minutes in which to get clear of the hospital, before the police would be asked to search for her. Whilst potentially beneficial from a therapeutic perspective, such knowledge may also inform a vulnerable patient on ways in which the protection afforded by a MHA Section could be undermined. The wisdom of explaining to a patient how the hospital staff would respond to them absconding should be reviewed. 7. Ms Tolley was found with a made from used some time earlier to dress a self-inflicted wound. She had twice before used such as : (1) earlier the same day and (2) three days previously- 24 October. Consideration should be given to the types of used at the Becklin Centre, with a view to selecting a type which could not serve as a . 8. The Inquest was informed that the general policy in relation to absconding patients has been under review since Ms Tolley\u2019s death nearly two years ago but has (understandably) been delayed during the Covid pandemic. It was said a draft revised policy was sent to West Yorkshire Police on 14 June 2021 by way of consultation, but no response has been received. In the meantime, similar instructions are still being issued to staff not to restrain or follow in some other cases.

Insufficiency of note-keeping. ii) The note made by Dr in the RiO records was described by an independent expert, Dr , as extremely brief. I accept that medical notes should not be defensive in nature but there is nothing at all in it to justify the view expressed that Kirsty was safe to 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED go home. In a context where she has, over a very recent period, attempted to on five occasions, the rationale explaining how it was felt she was safe to go home should, in my view, have been set out. Of perhaps more significance is that there was nothing in the note to assist clinicians with understanding how the future care plan was to be organised. That was in a context where a national lockdown was imminent. Given the unprecedented circumstances, it seems apparent to me that there was all the more reason to provide detail in this regard. The fact it was not set out, it seems to me, implies that there was doubt on the part of Dr about how the plan to continue treating Kirsty was to be organised. My fear is that this simply passed the burden of the management of the risk to . This reached an entirely foreseeable crisis in the early hours of 23 March. Kirsty had deteriorated to the point she was described as very suicidal. was exhausted from his desperate efforts to keep his wife safe. He rang the ward for assistance. There was no one available to help him. was advised to call the emergency services. He rang the police who told him to ring the ambulance service who told him to ring the CMHT in the morning. This should not have happened. A detailed plan with how to manage an acute deterioration could have prevented it. At the time, Doctor was effectively carrying the burden of two consultant psychiatrists in that Dr was away from work. I indicated at inquest that if this was due to under-resourcing of the Trust, I would write to those responsible for funding. I was advised that, in fact, the problem may be due to a scarcity of consultant psychiatrists nationally. I would be grateful if you could please let me know the position. iii) Lack of involvement of family\/carer in discharge process The Trust\u2019s own discharge policy states: 3. Principles The decision to discharge someone from hospital must be in keeping with the Care Programme Approach (CPA), (DH 1991, 2008) and governed by the following principles: The patient, carer and \/ or advocate, must be actively involved in all aspects of the discharge plan, where practicable. Arrangements for discharge should be negotiated with everyone likely to be concerned with the service user\u2019s aftercare. was Kirsty\u2019s carer. He had not been \u2018actively involved in all aspects of the discharge plan.\u2019 He had a phone call to come and collect her and on arriving at the hospital he found her bag to be packed. He did not feel as though he was given any choice. I acknowledged at inquest that there were extenuating circumstances in that Kirsty's discharge coincided with the first national lockdown during the COVID pandemic.

The transfer and review of prisoners on an ACCT. I am concerned in relation to the ability of any Prison to close an ACCT, with the attendance of 2 individuals (a prison and health care staff), after a short period of time on a newly transferred inmate (i.e. to a new prison) before anyone has had the time to review and assess him or her. For ACCTs created on current inmates within an establishment, who are known to staff, I do not see that as an issue, they would already have an existing knowledge and relationship and indeed would have been the originator of the ACCT in any event. However, for new prisoners, who have arrived from another prison establishment with an open ACCT on their record, I consider the ability to remove that individual from the ACCT, within a short period of time, does raise issues in respect of the knowledge and understanding of that individual and the ability of various agencies, within the prison, to have had time to review and communicate between themselves, about that individual. The provision of in effect 2 \u2018no\u2019 answers by a prisoner, is a potentially easy way of coming off an ACCT, which is there for their support and well-being, and I would suggest, given to easy manipulation I raise the issue as to whether there should be, for example, a set review period (e.g. 7 days) which allows time for the support services to meet with and interview the transferred inmate, interact, and then make a decision about and with the newly transferred prisoner on the ACCT before such an ACCT is closed.",["transfer","review","prisoners","acct","concerned","relation","ability","prison","close","acct","attendance","individuals","prison","health","care","staff","short","period","time","newly","transferred","inmate","new","prison","anyone","time","review","assess","accts","created","current","inmates","within","establishment","known","staff","see","issue","would","already","existing","knowledge","relationship","indeed","would","originator","acct","event","however","new","prisoners","arrived","another","prison","establishment","open","acct","record","consider","ability","remove","individual","acct","within","short","period","time","raise","issues","respect","knowledge","understanding","individual","ability","various","agencies","within","prison","time","review","communicate","individual","provision","effect","answers","prisoner","potentially","easy","way","coming","acct","support","would","suggest","given","easy","manipulation","raise","issue","whether","example","set","review","period","days","allows","time","support","services","meet","interview","transferred","inmate","interact","make","decision","newly","transferred","prisoner","acct","acct","closed"],["transfer","review","prisoner","acct","concerned","relation","ability","prison","close","acct","attendance","individual","prison","health","care","staff","short","period","time","newly","transfer","inmate","new","prison","anyone","time","review","ass","accts","create","current","inmate","within","establishment","know","staff","see","issue","would","already","exist","knowledge","relationship","indeed","would","originator","acct","event","however","new","prisoner","arrive","another","prison","establishment","open","acct","record","consider","ability","remove","individual","acct","within","short","period","time","raise","issue","respect","knowledge","understand","individual","ability","various","agency","within","prison","time","review","communicate","individual","provision","effect","answer","prisoner","potentially","easy","way","come","acct","support","would","suggest","give","easy","manipulation","raise","issue","whether","example","set","review","period","day","allow","time","support","service","meet","interview","transfer","inmate","interact","make","decision","newly","transfer","prisoner","acct","acct","close"],[-0.0218808539,0.0049843709,0.0226280335,0.0805915445,-0.0476703718,-0.0250085928,0.05302798,-0.0330952518,0.0997008309,0.0098669333,-0.0460043103,-0.1058299616,-0.0370974317,0.0236635059,-0.1252101213,0.093772389,0.0569008999,0.1074058637,-0.0245575514,-0.0632446781,0.0127805807,-0.0034054616,0.0118061751,0.0581243224,0.0416465178,-0.0386207439,-0.0938808843,0.0294133723,-0.0256790258,0.0059554302,0.0041477955,-0.0179515276,-0.0607579015,-0.0186421126,-0.0181356333,-0.040390484,0.0561347082,-0.0057386025,0.0222116057,0.0737129599,0.0340939499,-0.0213534255,0.060988456,-0.012785865,-0.0274482947,-0.0868652835,-0.0229249541,0.0337904021,-0.0584202744,0.0084519312,0.0077709761,-0.0345531516,-0.0170080476,-0.0082054762,-0.0202156436,0.0034387307,-0.0750749633,-0.0101785818,0.0459374599,-0.0688860565,-0.0121482471,-0.0094652642,-0.0530142225,-0.0446714498,-0.0360317528,-0.0220248122,-0.0823931471,0.0545889437,-0.0225978922,-0.0038034408,0.0285001192,0.0179976169,0.0751938149,0.0084491167,-0.1036458239,-0.0660152733,0.0871355012,0.0514537618,0.0388479531,0.0745513141,0.0273089167,-0.0631034747,0.0314408615,0.0576602109,0.0079548322,-0.0173621252,-0.1073933616,0.0782783404,0.0128280763,0.0310324375,0.1062714458,-0.0014196928,-0.0039290832,-0.0632445514,0.0362945311,-0.0603258274,0.0417995751,0.0465579741,0.0410685316,-0.0310789011,-0.0023037018,-0.0384201296,0.0043738005,0.0106452256,0.0264269728,-0.0691695884,-0.0534239598,-0.0333034955,0.0311484411,-0.0462046787,-0.0626210719,-0.0592175014,-0.0749142468,-0.0110881133,0.0492831804,0.0538027398,0.0301960185,-0.016549157,0.1036990955,0.0735170618,-0.0603770278,-0.0181038026,-0.0229369625,0.0737052634,0.0114551922,-0.0469245911,-0.0501533896,-0.0120114181,0.0177774578,0.0315491706,0.0006118524,-0.0870342553,-0.0776792467,-0.0401673242,-0.001584694,-0.0962039158,-0.0150631759,0.0048994077,0.025253484,0.0365086384,0.0757820532,-0.0161824767,-0.0416951403,0.0346941724,-0.0099922558,0.0197692942,-0.0472771674,-0.0394232087,-0.0353038348,0.0254188906,0.1165838987,0.0110002114,-0.0474058054,0.0233156793,0.0335132405,-0.0621150285,-0.0387398154,-0.0367344096,-0.0530588105,-0.0331721678,-0.0176660512,0.075775899,0.0041153254,0.0010015769,-0.0682005361,-0.008852724,0.0409070626,-0.0529005006,0.0309899952,0.0148357954,-0.0194501728,-0.037989255,-0.0213125255,-0.0683973953,0.00616305,-0.0391545519,0.0736227483,-0.0687048212,0.0095923692,-0.0051177605,-0.1055005193,-0.0406048894,0.0241301488,-0.0140757328,0.0245600212,-0.0597267784,-0.0035670078,0.0691883489,0.0397066213,0.0609749965,-0.0218796022,-0.0320316069,0.0259307791,0.0059955786,-0.0388319939,0.0167725366,-0.0388801284,-0.0284473225,-0.0557075888,-0.122

a. No thorough comprehensive risk new review was undertaken by a member of staff who had detailed knowledge of the deceased prior to his discharge from the inpatient unit. This was not identified before he left the ward and it was not discovered by the HBTT when they took over his care. b. The transfer and communication process from inpatient care to the HBTT appeared inadequate. b. There was no clear plan to deal with the risk of his condition deteriorating and him experiencing significantly more suicidal thoughts as well as obtaining the means by which to kill himself. It is well known that a history of suicidal thoughts and actions increases the risk when they are repeated. c. When he disclosed that he bought there was no risk review planning involving a senior HBTT clinician which was then monitored even when he indicated that he had received it. d. On several occasions before he died the deceased saw members of the HBTT but they failed to demonstrate professional curiosity and enquire about his suicidal thoughts and plans. There were either adequate or no records about this. e. There were a number of missed opportunities for the HBTT to assess changes in his 3 presentation and risk profile. f. There was no robust audit system for checking compliance with the trust own policies and protocols in particular with regard to medical record keeping, risk assessments and reviews. g. The GMMH SUI investigation report contained several factual errors and misinterpretations. It was only discovered at the inquest hearing that one of the last members of HBBT staff to see the deceased had given an account that was not the same as given to their line manager. This meant the all the lessons for future care and planning were not learnt.

the course of the inquest evidence was heard from a number of witnesses of the supervision and staffing arrangements within SACfrom a number of witnesses of the supervision and staffing arrangements within SACU. The overall position was that there was no supervising officer present on a day to day basis to ensure key tasks were always allocated or completed, and officers, including officers not posted to the SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various tasks between themselves on an adhoc basis. On the 2nd September 2019 the document setting out which hourly checks had been undertaken in the SACU was incomplete. No check on Mr Todd\u2019s cell took place at 3pm that day. Evidence was heard that staffing levels can vary, with officers being occupied on tasks which meant hourly checks could not always be completed. Whilst there is auditing of the hourly checks retrospectively, there is no \u2018real time\u2019 system which would alert officers and their supervisors to checks being incomplete for a prisoner\/s as

Response to Mental Health Concerns by Reception Staff During the course of the inquest, Mr Martin Smith, Siwan's husband, raised concerns that on 18th November 2020, Siwan telephoned the Medical Centre to obtain an urgent appointment with a doctor. She was informed by the receptionist that the earliest appointment was on 30th November 2020. The Medical Centre provided me with a report which indicated that when Siwan asked about whether there were any emergency appointments for mental health problems she was advised that these are not routinely offered unless a patient is having \"bad thoughts\". Your report states that an emergency appointment was not requested and at no point was it suggested the call was a mental health emergency. The Medical Centre provided me with a recording of the telephone exchange between Siwan and the receptionist. I found during the inquest that Siwan asked repeatedly if she could have an earlier appointment and was clearly upset that she could not. She was not asked if she was having bad thoughts or whether she required urgent mental health support. It was clear towards the end of the conversation that Siwan was distressed. I also received in evidence a letter dated 8 March 2021 written By , the Practice Manager to Mr Smith, in which she implies that the receptionists are not clinically trained to make assessments. I accept this, however in the circumstances I determined that Siwan should have received a call back from someone who was clinically trained to ascertain whether she required an urgent mental health assessment. In the circumstances I did not find that a different course of action would have prevented Siwan's death or would have altered the outcome. However I am concerned that lives could be put at risk in the future if there continues to be a lack of awareness of when a patient may require a clinical assessment in relation to their mental

was given by a Prison Service Governor and HMP Rochester, the Head of Healthcare at HMP Rochester and (by letter) Prison-NOMIS Application Support And Change Manager that: (1) Critical information relating to prisoners contained on his Prison National Offender Management Information System (\u201cNOMIS\u201d). (2) Prison Service staff and clinical staff working with prisoners are permitted to (and need) access NOMIS in order to keep prisoners safe. (3) Use of NOMIS is restricted to those who have been trained to use it (via a short online course known as the \u2018Getting Started\u2019 module). Once the online training has been completed the person is issued with a certificate. That certificate is then provided to the MOJ Business Application Support Team \/ Justice Digital & Technology. That department then issues the person a NOMIS username and password. The turnaround time is usually two days. (4) Whilst all prison staff were trained in the use of this system and were able to access it, only some clinical staff are able to access NOMIS. (5) The reason that all Prison Service Staff were able to access NOMIS was because training in the use of NOMIS is a compulsory part of their training. (6) The reason that only some clinical staff could access NOMIS was because it is voluntary (although encouraged and supported by the MOJ). (7) If NOMIS training was a compulsory part of training for all clinicians working with prisoners: a. It is likely that most (if not all) nurses would be able to access NOMIS within a relatively short period of time. b. Prisoners would, as a result, be safer. c. The Business Application Support Team \/ Justice Digital & Technology at the MOJ would welcome and support such training (see attached letter from from that team dated 3 September 2021). I am concerned that: (a) Lee died partly because of a lack of training which prevented staff from accessing and reviewing information. (b) NOMIS contains important information that can be of use to clinical staff when looking after prisoners. (c) Not all nurses can access NOMIS because it is not a compulsory part of their training. (d) The NOMIS training is already available, can be completed online and access to NOMIS can be gained within two days. (e) If the current situation continues there is a risk that prisoners may die as a result. This situation should be reviewed and consideration given to whether NOMIS training should be made compulsory for clinicians working within prisons in England and Wales. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and\/or your organisation have the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 November 2021. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the following: \u2022 HHJ Thomas Teague QC, the Chief Coroner of England & Wales \u2022 Mr Thrumble\u2019s family \u2022 HMP Elmley \u2022 HMP Rochester \u2022 Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust \u2022 Integrated Care 24 I am under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9.

The lack of knowledge of the Probation officer as to the services she could contact to obtain necessary mental health assessments. This would appear at the very least to suggest this gap in knowledge may be due to inadequate training. (2) Mr Salter being driven to desperate measures of committing criminal acts in an effort to be arrested or recalled in order to secure treatment and support; this appeared to be the way matters were moving forward without engaging with appropriate mental health services. (3) Generally poor engagement and collaborative working with both agencies and family alike. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you , National Probation Service have the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13th July 2021 . I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons: , Messrs Browne Jacobson and Government Legal Department. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. undy LLB (Ho s) Senior Coroner for South

During the course of the inquest evidence was hear in regard to the fact that each patient who is under the care of the CMHT should be allocated a Care Co-Ordinator. This Care Co-Ordinator will be responsible for co-ordinating the care that each CMHT patient will receive. (2) The allocation of the Care Co-Ordinator was of concern as there was no system to ensure that a Care Co-Ordinator was actually being allocated into this role. What was taking place was that a clinician was being chosen, in Rebecca Pyketts case, her Consultant Psychiatrist who was no, in fact carrying out the role, and tasks expected as a care co-ordinator. (3) An example would be that the allocated Care Co-Ordinator should be allocated within 5 days, see their patient within 5 days, and complete a care plan. This did not happen in Rebecca Pyketts\u2019 case. (4) It appears that there was routine allocation of the allocated Consultant Psychiatrists as care co- ordinator. The reason behind this routine allocation was that Lorenzo (the patient record keeping system employed by the north Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust), required this box to be filled in. Therefore the allocation of the care Co-Ordinator was being dealt with as a \u201cbox ticking\u201d exercise, to satisfy the record keeping system.

The safeguarding team of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster did not exercise sufficient professional scrutiny of the allegations that came to them from the Anglican safeguarding team. This was partly because they gained a false sense of security from the fact that the allegations came from the Church of England.However, there was more that could have been done to establish the exact nature of the allegations and whether these were credible. The Catholic safeguarding team asked for disclosure from the Anglican safeguarding team and most particularly for the source of the allegations. When they did not receive either of these, they should have insisted. 2. The Catholic safeguarding team met with Father Griffin on 23 June 2020 to discuss his DBS check. That would have been an ideal opportunity to discuss the Church of England allegations that would have shortened the process considerably and the opportunity was lost. 3 3. Father Griffin then asked to know the allegations against him before he attended another meeting with the Catholic safeguarding team. The safeguarding team felt that the information was not theirs to give because it came from the Church of England, but Father Griffin should have been provided with a note of the allegations promptly. 4. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster was unaware of Father Griffin\u2019s attempted suicide nine years earlier. However, it could still have been more proactive than it was in ensuring that he had maximum pastoral support. 5. The Catholic safeguarding team volunteered at inquest that they did not deal with the investigation into Father Griffin promptly and they apologised for this. The very first telephone call was placed to the Catholic safeguarding adviser on 30 October 2019. The delay was therefore significant and it was harmful. This was in part because the Catholic safeguarding team were waiting for the engagement of the Anglican safeguarding team to enable a joint approach to be taken.

Child & Adolescent Mental Health Centre provides services to children and young people, some of whom may require Mental Health Act assessment. There is no protocol or policy for those that require Mental Health? Act assessment and will not voluntarily attend hospital Accident & Emergency. There was a Safety Plan in place for Ellis that included that he should go to Accident & Emergency if he could not keep himself safe, even with support. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \u2013 (1) Ellis\u2019s Safety Plan did not set out: a. the responsibilities of the Child & Adolescent Mental Health Team b. did not contain a contingency plan should Ellis agree to go to Accident & Emergency (2) On 30th September 2020 there was a deviation from the agreed Safety Plan without an updated risk assessment. (3) Not all relevant information was shared between the Child & Adult Mental Health Team about the circumstances disclosed of events on the night of 29th September of Ellis\u2019s failed attempt at hanging as part of a risk assessment. (4) Ellis was found to be in need of a Mental Health Act assessment. Management advice was sought about risk and what action should be taken should Ellis refuse to go to hospital, the advice was contact the police.

trust have themselves admitted the failures reflected in an independent report they commissioned after the death, that report said \u201cwe would not expect a patients level of risk to be downgraded from high \u2026 to medium immediately following a suicide attempt\u201d; In addition I heard evidence in relationist to the assessment on the 26th July 2019 when the risk was downgraded from high to medium. I listened very carefully to the steps that the Trust has taken to make changes following this death and I am pleased that a number of changes have taken place. I raised my concern about the downgrading of risk from high to medium in this case by two members of the team that had no previous dealings with Maria. Maria was well known to the trust and her own care coordinator said \u201cWe were concerned about the ongoing risk of completed suicide given she continued to be in possession of a helium bottle, the risk was not considered to have changed since my first meeting with her when the risk to self was recorded as high\u201d. That was a reference to a multidisciplinary meeting which took place a matter of weeks before her death. I was told that risk is dynamic and that professionals assess risk at the time and that it can go up and down. I was also told that there are lots of assessments by staff that do not know patients. That said there is a concern that there is a risk of future death - is it right that the risk of a patient, who is well known to the trust, with a care coordinator who knew her well, is downgraded

There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care with the local pharmacy. As a result, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact that the treating psychiatric team had a safety plan involving Sam\u2019s parents being responsible for handling and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware of this plan, it is likely that they would either have refused to provide the medication with which Sam overdosed or, at least, contacted Sam\u2019s parents or General Practitioner. (2) A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust\u2019s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures that any pharmacy used regularly by their patients aged 16-17 are (where appropriate) advised of relevant care plans, as well as the responsible GP being so informed. This is now to be part of mandatory training for CAMHS prescribing staff and is to be discussed in the local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between the local NHS Trusts, G.P.s and local pharmacies. Accordingly, action has already been taken in the local area to prevent similar fatalities.

Following completed suicides on the railway2023network BTP and Network Rail are both involved in considering further mitigating measures that may be appropriate at the location to guard against further fatalities. (2) In Chris\u2019 case, earlier consideration to the fence boundary being a credible route of access may have ledto the fence boundary being improved more quickly after her death. (3) I am concerned that your investigation into, and consideration of, Chris\u2019 death did not keep a sufficiently open mind that she may have climbed the boundary fence to access the railway line. If similar assumptions are made in other investigations, there is a risk of future fatalities: there is a risk that mitigating measures will be missed if BTP and Network Rail too readily assume that one point of access to the railway was used when the evidence permits of credible alternative routes of access.

Overnight assistance for adolescent mental challenges patients being cared for at home but with high levels of need (For CPFT and CCC). I heard evidence of increased funding for CPFT being used to extend home treatment options, but that this would be unlikely to extend to a 24\/7 service. I also heard evidence from CCC that available support would now be considered under s17 Children Act or s117 Mental Health Act or both but that this would need to be jointly funded between social care and health. I remain concerned that a clear pathway to securing overnight assistance (even if only on a respite basis) for similar cases of exceptional need has not yet been clearly agreed between CPFT and CCC. I am concerned that if alternative supported accommodation in the community were the best solution, there does not appear to be provision for it in-area, so that admission to a mental health unit becomes more likely. (2) Involvement of CCC alongside CPFT in complex adolescent mental health cases where the risk is of suicide \/ self-harm (For CCC). In some respects CCC\u2019s involvement in Chris and Sam\u2019s care (social care and education) lacked direction, focus, knowledge and efficiency. I heard evidence of improvements in training in the relevant education and social work teams, and concerning the new Strong Families, Strong Communities Securing Best Outcomes for Children Strategy (March 2021). Further, that CCC is restructuring all of its early help and adolescent services and will be implementing a formal contextual safeguarding framework and that these developments will be in place by the end of 2021. I am concerned that in the midst of restructuring and new guidance, there remains a risk that education inclusion officers and social workers on the ground may still not have sufficient knowledge, guidance and supervision to ensure that CCC give practical and robust support to parents and adolescent patients, alongside treating healthcare agencies, where the main risk of serious harm to the child is from self- harm or suicide arising from adolescent mental health disorders, rather than neglect of harm by a third party. (3) Diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (For CPFT). I am concerned that the evidence in Chris\u2019 case, in particular, suggested a degree of age-related reluctance consistently to use the terminology of Borderline Personality Disorder (or Emerging Personality Disorder or EUPD), even when a highly specialist second opinion had supported this and appeared to have been accepted. There are risks associated with a reluctance to use a personality disorder diagnosis (c.f. Position Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists dated January 2020). I received evidence that there have already been some changes\/improvements in the preparedness to recognise Borderline Personality Disorder and that further consideration will be given in the context of the new ICD 11. (4) AWOL patients from Darwin Centre for Young People (For CPFT). I heard evidence that since Chris\u2019 death, staff have been reminded of the applicable policies; and that an audit has shown good compliance with the provision for calling the local signallers. I heard evidence that there is to be a further review of CPFT\u2019s own AWOL policy. I remain concerned that: (i) CPFT\u2019s own policy is too lengthy and complex to serve as reference-guidance during a live AWOL incident. In particular the flow chart summary is unnecessarily complex and hard to follow (at least as a tool to consult during a stressful incident); (ii) there is a risk of confusion in having two policies both of which are meant to be followed; (iii) there did not appear be desktop-drills \/ other training exercises \/ information grab-packs (etc.) to ensure that all nurses in charge are properly equipped and trained to deal with AWOL incidents efficiently (iv) steps ought to be taken at managerial level to ensure that the confusion over the two policies and whether one had been superseded

In December 2019 a software update had been installed to a system in the Kent Force Control room which, if used, produced a much greater accuracy in detecting the location of mobile phone calls. There had been inadequate or no training on the use of the update which resulted in the system not being deployed to locate the deceased. The call from the deceased at 22.18 was therefore incorrectly downgraded as the area to search was regarded as too wide to be effective. The downgrade was incorrect because (a) the use of the software would have provided an accurate location and (b) the call should have been treated as a suicide call and not an abandoned 999 call. It is accepted that as a direct result of this incident the software system is now the default setting to detect locations. However, the evidence of those witnesses who were required to use the system raised a more general enquiry which identified gaps in or absence of effective training and the cascading of information. (2) The totality of the evidence from several experienced operatives in the Force Control Room revealed gaps in their knowledge as to operating procedure in respect of the suicide policy, appropriate downgrading of calls, checking available patrols. Whilst it is accepted that following an IOPC report steps have been taken to review and improve procedures, it was apparent that there was an absence of an effective system to identify those that required training\/updating and of the keeping a record of the specific training\/updating received by individual operatives and the date it was undertaken. There did not appear to be a structured system in place to produce a regular training rotation which monitored and recorded individual satisfactory progress.

Bampfylde had a long history of mental health problems and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Following a settled period, her mental health deteriorated leading to the attempted overdose in October 2019. Following an unsuccessful referral to Time to Talk services, Hannah was referred to HATS, the entry point into specialist mental health services. Assessment appointments were made for 26th November 2019, which 3 Hannah did not attend, and 4th December 2019, which was altered at short notice by HATS to 6th December 2019, when Hannah was at work. No further appointments were made by HATS and Hannah did not contact the service herself to reschedule. Hannah\u2019s GP was not made aware that she had missed appointments and that she was not therefore effectively under the care of the service until HATS wrote to the GP on 1st April 2020 advising them that Hannah had been discharged for non- engagement. Whilst there was not sufficient evidence before the Court to conclude that the lack of an assessment by HATS and therefore Mental Health Services input into Hannah\u2019s care caused or contributed to her death, the evidence highlighted a lack of clarity and potential for persons newly referred to the service to not engage without their GP being aware of this. The two GPs who had contact with Hannah both stated they were unaware of any protocols being in place, either at the time of Hannah\u2019s death or in the interim, to ensure all non-engagement with services should be communicated with the patient\u2019s GP, although the Trust\u2019s own Serious Incident Report into Hannah\u2019s death identified that such a protocol should be in place. HATS use the Trust\u2019s \u201cActive Engagement Incorporating Did Not Attend (DNA) Policy & Procedure\u201d (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) in governing the standards of how to promote engagement with service users, to include those awaiting assessment and those already under the care of the service. The Policy provides general guidance to professionals in deciding on the action to be taken when a person does not attend an appointment with them, but does not give a clear pathway to avoid newly referred patients slipping through the system. From the evidence given to the Court, it was not clear who was responsible for re-booking appointments in the event of a DNA, or at what stage non-attendances should be escalated for review with the Referrals Co-ordinator. The Policy describes a \u201cMulti-Disciplinary Review Meeting\u201d taking place prior to a non-attending person being discharged back to primary care, but this does not apply to new referrals to the HATS where a Multi- Disciplinary team would not be in place and discussion would instead take place between the Assessor and Referrals Co-ordinator. There was no detail of this discussion in Hannah\u2019s notes although evidence was given that it had taken place. 4 The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - Appointments are not automatically re-booked when a person has failed to attend an appointment. - It is not clear who should re-book appointments when a person has failed to attend (Administration or Assessors). - GPs are not routinely notified if a person has not attended an appointment with the HATS, meaning the GP would be unaware the person was not receiving input from the HATS until they had failed to attend a number of appointments and were discharged back to primary care, potentially many months after being referred.

evidence clearly identified a gap in service provision in the Norfolk and Waveney area for the cohort of patients into which Sean fitted. Although having been identified as ARMS by the EIPT in Norfolk and Waveney, Sean nonetheless did not fit the strict criteria for accessing that service as he was deemed to have not yet suffered a first episode of psychosis; however his level of risk was sufficiently high that he was also considered unsuitable for WBS. Additionally, the evidence confirmed that Sean did not fit the criteria of either the Community Mental Health Team, the Crisis Team or MIND. In contrast, in the neighbouring Suffolk area (and the evidence suggested in many other areas of the country) ARMS patients are recognised as falling under the commissioned EIPT umbrella and therefore receive commissioned assessment, treatment and management from that team. This lacunae in service provision in Norfolk and Waveney meant that, at the time of his death, Sean fell between services and did not receive any appropriate care. In my opinion the continuation of such a lacunae in commissioned service provision gives rise to the risk of future

Mary was discharged from the Abraha2023m Cowley Unit without a discharge planning meeting taking place in circumstances where there was no confirmation that she was eligible for housing provision and with no plan was to what would happen after the Travel Lodge placement ended. There is no policy in place which prevents a vulnerable patient being discharged into homelessness from the Abraham Cowley Unit. 2. Mary was not subject to a medical review from the 28th March 2018 to the 26th May 2018. There is no policy in place which mandates when or if a patient should be subject to face to face review by a consultant psychiatrist after discharge from the acute unit. 3. No formal risk assessment was undertaken of Mary and no risk assessment was recorded in her records prior to her discharge from the Abraham Cowley Unit. 4. The informal risk assessments undertaken in the Abraham Cowley Unit prior to her discharge failed to place any weight on the impact on Mary of a discharge with an inchoate plan for her housing and arrived at an incorrect assessment of her risk. The risk assessments were not sufficiently rigorous and evidence based. 5. Mary was prematurely discharged from the Abraham Cowley Unit suffering from severe depression and before sufficient time had been taken to observe the effectiveness of her prescribed medication. This appears in part to have been because the imperative to discharge patients took precedence over adequate discharge planning and assessment. The CPA ( \u201c Care Programme Approach\u201d) was not followed. 6. Mary was discharged from the Home Treatment team on ineffective medication and without any coherent plan for her care in the community. Her care coordinator was not involved in the discharge planning. The CPA was not followed. 7. The fact that she was placed out of area made it difficult for her to participate in community based treatment and significantly impacted on the ability of her care coordinator and community psychiatrist to support her.

Patient notes in the Accident and Emergency Department at the Princess Royal In circumstances where a patient attends A & E at the PRH with a mental health concern they can be seen by a Senior Nurse Practitioner or a Doctor working for SPFT who assesses them; however patient care remains the responsibility of PRH. SPFT have reviewed their practice so that a contemporaneous note of their consultation is copied from Carenotes and placed in the A & E paper notes. Evidence from a PRH witness at the Inquest confirmed that Mr Costello\u2019s paper notes should have been updated every 2-3 hours to provide an accurate account of how he was progressing. The witness indicated that the notes themselves which PRH staff use (paper notes) needed updating and reviewing. This had been done previously for the PRH but then discarded following review by a Senior Nurse at the A & E department at Royal Sussex County Hospital which is also run by the same Trust. It is requested that the Trust consider updating the A and E notes on both sites at the very earliest opportunity and to include note of the need to regularly update them in line with policies and that all staff in A & E receive training on the need to complete those notes regularly with emphasis on the importance of recognising the notes as a vital tool in recording and evaluating a

The purpose of undertaking a Serious Untoward Incident Investigation, is to identify necessary organisational changes which can improve the outcomes for patients and hopefully prevent future deaths. Rory had been discharged from acuteword services and was under the care of his General Practitioner. In keeping with many people he had been involved with different arms of ABUHB (primary, acute and psychiatric) He had been involved with social services. After his death the charity MIND wrote to me and expressed concerns that Rory had fallen between gaps in services. This was addressed in the internal investigation undertaken by ABUHB, however it is surprising that his GP was not involved in this review and Dr e told me that GPs are rarely asked to participate in these investigations. In order that lessons can be learned and opportunities identified for better partnership working around patients, it would seem appropriate that the patient's primary care contact (especially when

On the 4th May 2020 Azra's mother and daughter had been in telephone contact with the nurse in charge on the ward expressing concerns that Azra had messaged them to say she had attempted suicide using shoelaces as a ligature. The nurse spoke to Azra who denied making a ligature, Azra's neck was examined and she had no marks.rks from ligature use. The shoelaces from one pair of shoes were removed but other shoelaces, clothing and bedding were left in her possession as it was felt that Azra was not at an immediate risk. She was not believed to be at immediate risk because, whilst it was a feature of her mental state common to many patients that she would regularly talk about not wanting to live and requesting an overdose, there was no evidence that she had made an active suicide attempt and she had no history of suicide or self-harm attempts. The fact that she was now saying that she had attempted to make a ligature was a change in her presentation (her previous suicidal ideation had centred around requesting assistance to overdose), it was also of significance that she was saying one thing to her family and something different to a clinician. BSMHT accepted that the information was significant and therefore there ought to have been consideration of it by her treating team with a review of her risk and observation levels. However, no record at all was made of the family's concerns and the account given by Azra. Her risk screen was not updated, an incident report was not raised, and the information was not included in handover to the next shift or at the next MDT on the 6th May. Therefore, it was not considered at an MDT meeting on the 6th May 2020. Due to the COVID19 pandemic Azra's family could not attend that meeting and raise their concerns directly. Microsoft Teams was used by some clinicians to attend the MDT on the 6th May but was not made available to Azra's family nor was a telephone number to dial into the meeting. BSMHT has put in a system for a form to be completed in advance of an MDT which requires the family's input to be sought, placed on the form and considered in the MDT. It is my concern that this is equivalent to the family being included in the meeting (prior to COVID families were invited to attend MDTs): there is the potential that information will not be recorded accurately or will not be understood in written form, it also doesn't afford family the opportunity to hear the plan arising from the meeting and provide their views. There is no reason why attendance by a remote platform or telephone line at the meeting itself cannot be offered to family for all MDTs. 2. BSMHT had risk assessed ward 2 for ligature points, including the en-suite bathrooms, in November 2019. The en-suite bathroom doors were given the highest risk score possible on an acute ward, but no corrective action was identified to remove or mitigate the risk: the risk assessment relied on clinical assessment and observation of the service user to mitigate the risk. Evidence was given at the inquest that pressure sensor alarms have been available in the UK from numerous manufacturers for 10 years, BSMHT had been investigating and testing different pressure sensor alarms for en-suite bathroom doors for approximately 2 years before Azra's death. BSMHT has now identified an appropriate pressure sensor for en-suite bathroom doors and the en-suite bathroom door of room 14 on ward 2 was replaced in November 2020 with a door incorporating a pressure sensor alarm. BSMHT has a 17 month program to fit pressure sensor alarms to all en-suite bathroom doors within its inpatient units. However, this is not being considered for other doors within the bedroom area nor is there any national requirement for in- patient mental health units to place, or consider placing, pressure sensor alarms on doors within areas where patients are afforded privacy and time alone. I am concerned that within BSMHT's inpatient units there will be a continuing risk from other doors in the bedroom area (including the main bedroom door) even when the en-suite bathroom doors are fitted with pressure sensor alarms. Although the outer face of a bedroom door will be on a communal corridor, service users on level 1 and 2 observations will have periods where they are unobserved in their rooms and could wedge a ligature at the top of a door so that it wasn't obviously visible from outside. Furthermore, in the absence of any national regulations or guidance on this topic the risk from en-suite and other doors in areas where service users spend time unobserved will persist in mental

to those with whom he worked at Wembley Fire Station, Jaden\u2019s mental well being was deteriorating significantly in the last weeks of his life, and it deteriorated to the point where he killed himself. I heard at inquest that the London Fire Brigade has quite sophisticated systems in place to support firefighters suffering mental ill health. However, Jaden was not offered the support of, for example, psychological counselling, because it was not appreciated that he was so very low. Obviously if firefighters are to be given the best chance of recovering from mental ill health, their difficulties first need to be recognised. I appreciate that it can be difficult to detect that a person may be depressed or exceptionally unhappy. Signs may be subtle and require a nuanced approach. \uf0b7 Jaden often complained that he was bored because Wembley Green Watch had not been called to many incidents. I heard evidence that boredom in a new firefighter can be quite common. However, I also heard that a complaint of boredom can be a sign of a person with dyslexia avoiding an unpalatable or daunting task. \uf0b7 Jaden had dyslexia and was worried that he would not be able to complete his written work in order to become a fully qualified firefighter, yet the reality was that his station officer was fully aware of his difficulties and had tried to reassure Jaden that he was certainly capable of achieving his goal. \uf0b7 He did need extra time, the space to make mistakes and a degree of sensitivity that was not always afforded him. On the other hand, he asked for help and was given a mentor, but did not make use of him and so eventually the mentorship ceased. That request for help followed by a refusal of help was not explored. Such an exploration might have led to a greater understanding of how Jaden could be helped. \uf0b7 Jaden felt he was being treated unfairly at work and his family have formed the view that there was an element of racism there, driven in part by their belief that Jaden was the only non white person on Wembley Green Watch. Yet the reality was that he joined a watch where a quarter of the firefighters were people of colour. 3 \uf0b7 He described being teased about bringing chicken, rice and peas to work to eat, thinking that this teasing was because the food was Caribbean. Looking at this from the outside, chicken, rice and peas seems a dish without obvious world origin. Moreover, I heard about a huge variety of food being brought to work by firefighters, with some even weighing their food before eating. None of this sits easily with a dish of chicken, rice and peas resulting in a racist comment. Jaden\u2019s interior life did not always accord with what was going on around him. Most of all he felt isolated, and yet it was clear to me that he there was a lot of affection for him at the fire station. He did not always feel comfortable there. It is not necessarily an easy task to unearth such feelings in a colleague but, if it results in such a tragedy as this being avoided, it is a worthwhile one. I should be grateful if you, or whoever you delegate to investigate this matter, would listen to the entirety of the recording of this inquest. The London Fire Brigade investigation report already produced, talks in some detail about the station culture.

The National Probation Service Approved Premises Manual 2014 requires Approved Premises to put in place a local procedure for the collection\/delivery of residents\u2019 prescribed medication. The residents are not to be permitted to collect it themselves; - In December 2018 the National Probation Service introduced the Safe Working Practices Document which sets out NPS policies and procedures in relation to various aspects of resident safety. Each Approved Premises is required to adaptthe document to include their local procedure in respect of the delivery\/collection of residents\u2019 prescribed medication. Each Approved Premises is also required to maintain a Register confirming that every member of staff has read and understood the Safe Working Practices Document for the particular Approved Premises they work in. - However, the Area Manager for Approved Premises in Surrey, Sussex and Bedfordshire gave evidence that prior to the inquest she had not previously been aware of the requirement to set up a system for the delivery\/collection of prescribed medication as set out in the Approved Premises Manual 2014 and she had not previously seen a copy of the Safe Working Practices Document 2018. - The witness also gave evidence that until very recently there had not been no procedure in place for the collection\/delivery of residents\u2019 prescribed medication at St. Catherine\u2019s Priory in Guildford or at the Approved Premises in Brighton. - The National Probation Service was unable to provide the court with a copy of the Safe Working Practices Document for St. Catherine\u2019s Priory. - St. Catherine\u2019s Priory does not have a Register confirming that every member of staff had read and understood the Safe Working Practices Document. E 5 Accordingly I am concerned that: - Staff at St Catherine\u2019s Priory Approved Premises in Guildford, as well as staff in other Approved Premises nationally, may not be familiar with, or applying, the guidance set out in the Safe Working Practices Document in relation to the delivery\/collection of residents\u2019 prescribed medication, but also more generally in relation to the other policies and procedures pertaining to resident safety in that document. The MATTER OF CONCERN is: - Staff at St Catherine\u2019s Priory Approved Premises in Guildford, as well as staff in other Approved Premises nationally, may not be familiar with, or applying, the guidance set out in the Safe Working Practices Document in relation to the delivery\/collection of residents\u2019 prescribed medication, but also more generally in relation to the other policies and procedures pertaining to resident safety in that document. 7 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to take such action. 8 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.

The concern arises in relation to the impact this then had on the provision of and signposting of him to appropriate victim support given his recognised and known vulnerabilities.",["evidence","inquest","gmp","recorded","assault","weapon","crime","within","crime","recording","system","accepted","happened","concern","arises","relation","impact","provision","signposting","appropriate","victim","support","given","recognised","known","vulnerabilities"],["evidence","inquest","gmp","record","assault","weapon","crime","within","crime","record","system","accept","happened","concern","arise","relation","impact","provision","signpost","appropriate","victim","support","give","recognise","know","vulnerability"],[-0.0105622606,-0.014612834,0.0543263741,0.0044619241,-0.1125818864,0.0366872139,0.057932537,-0.0547739677,0.1678212434,0.0897776261,-0.0325164795,-0.1052907333,0.0052998862,0.0888748169,-0.0690027848,0.0624961853,0.0002562205,0.0564778633,0.0050354004,-0.1975911409,0.0189773645,-0.0260594692,0.0126978559,0.0198947582,0.0699386597,-0.0658925399,-0.0405069999,0.0363171883,0.0388997383,0.0193481445,-0.0209821071,-0.1205368042,-0.0375823975,-0.0404294319,-0.0420020409,-0.0194447841,0.0534261055,-0.0254529323,0.0310668945,0.0678291321,0.0383656807,0.0475082397,0.0214538574,0.0103098555,-0.0460459404,-0.0729166642,-0.0092875166,-0.0047073364,-0.0625762939,0.0763212815,0.0520375557,-0.0348777771,-0.0262393951,-0.0642738342,-0.0259195957,-0.0251032505,-0.1373341829,-0.0578460693,-0.0168024693,-0.0737438202,-0.0497716255,0.0599365234,-0.0259602871,-0.0695508346,-0.0505867004,-0.0238672886,-0.0819689408,0.0564066581,-0.1646931916,0.0565668754,0.0014928182,-0.0370370559,0.1268081665,0.0125711756,-0.1381835938,-0.0529022217,0.1281102449,0.0638529435,0.1113204956,0.0562934875,0.0537465401,-0.0029288132,0.0136076612,-0.0506668091,-0.0023040771,-0.0668869019,-0.1386515349,0.085193634,0.0217514038,0.0520820618,0.1176465377,0.0160401668,-0.0266300831,-0.0256945286,0.0360921212,-0.0841182098,0.1044794694,0.0779571533,0.07030233,-0.0363286324,-0.0010617574,-0.0073108673,0.0612449646,-0.0015258789,0.0040105185,-0.1384735107,-0.0306193028,-0.0343602486,0.0034586589,-0.0753377303,-0.0847803727,-0.0216560364,-0.0555470772,-0.0272633228,-0.009798686,-0.0156280193,-0.0134480791,-0.0343030281,0.0412743501,0.141494751,-0.056812603,0.0798187256,-0.0113525391,0.0737406388,-0.0616836548,-0.0443089791,-0.0512835197,-0.0751647949,0.0362472534,0.0520553589,0.0233154297,-0.0879173279,-0.124623619,-0.0183566418,0.0195706692,-0.0389626808,0.0683186874,0.0172831211,-0.0701904297,0.0728054047,0.0204381943,0.0553010292,-0.0161081944,0.0788294449,-0.0269622803,-0.0325393677,-0.0385119133,-0.0454419442,-0.1413167268,0.0012308756,0.1199289933,0.0092646284,-0.0321998596,-0.0096918745,0.0048217773,0.010050456,-0.1183637008,-0.0466245599,-0.0441894531,-0.1298624724,0.031463623,0.0539245605,0.0631306991,-0.0850168839,-0.0811767578,-0.0386174507,0.0067558289,-0.0585594177,0.0549418144,-0.0037352245,0.0445988961,-0.0243962612,-0.0609690361,-0.1204961166,0.0223922729,-0.0716552734,0.1085077897,-0.0742263794,-0.0256373081,0.0049718223,-0.0376586914,0.0158742275,-0.0196374264,-0.0958099365,-0.0397097282,0.0024185181,-0.079497017,0.068562828,0.0368563347,0.0708122253,-0.0099487305,-0.0357602425,-0.0000317891,0.0424461365,-0.0719095841,0.0131225586,0.0239283238,-0.045753479,0.0231577549,-0.1271158904,0.0185801182,0.0739265308,-0.050496418,-0.0623299293,0.015712738,-0.0022150676,-0.045665741,0.0124880476,0.0622940063,-0.0855442658,-0.0077517829,0.0128561659,0.0249781609,0.0387172699,-0.1653162688,0.0075964332,0.0653788224,-0.00782903,-0.0942281112,0.0277493801,-0.0344238281,-0.0003026327,-0.0082753496,-0.0206591282,0.0330632515,-0.0400085449,0.1459960938,0.0061823525,0.0350602455,0.0615606308,-0.011516571,0.0082256496,-0.0095291138,0.0299536381,0.0419616699,0.0163294468,0.0137227373,-0.0270792637,0.148598358,-0.0002365112,-0.0076395669,-0.046869915,-0.0062567391,-0.084587574,-0.0887196884,0.0455678292,-0.0235703792,0.0144815445,0.0750834122,-0.0625705719,0.019618988,0.0609283447,-0.0429801941,-0.025494894,0.0796305314,-0.0198987331,0.0735015869,0.0010579427,-0.0646324158,-0.0626754761,-0.0349248238,-0.0185292568,-0.1168314591,0.035199482,0.0034281414,0.1344578266,-0.0320620537,-0.0342114754,-0.1740760803,-0.1160678864,-0.0125700636,0.0909474716,0.0489247628,0.0999552384,0.0027821858,-0.0443878174,0.029335022,-0.1268717498,0.0091320677,-0.0071716309,-0.0140126543,-0.0087362928,0.0793002471,0.076548256,-0.0406494141,-0.0652109757,-0.0480206795,0.0393397026,0.0245056152,0.0593744926,-0.0635045394,0.0021197002,0.0039634705,0.0288950596,-0.068147026,-0.0160851479,-0.0099226637,-0.1578776091,-0.005643209,-0.0317834206]],["1. The inquest heard that psychology assessment and therapies can be very beneficial to those with mental health issues in secondary services as well as primary services. The evidence given was that the delay that Mrs Mitchell experienced in accessing that service was reflective of both the regional and national backlog.or appointments. The inquest was told that the position had worsened since 2019 and for example someone in Mrs Mitchell\u2019s position today would be more likely to wait 9 months than the 7 months in 2019. 2. Mrs Mitchell on two occasions could not be accommodated locally when an inpatient stay was required. The evidence heard at the inquest was that this was due to limited national mental health bed capacity against the demand within mental health services. The inquest heard evidence that suggested that this impacted on how she could be supported by her family and overall care. 3. It was accepted at the inquest that information gathering from family could be beneficial. However, there was a reluctance by health professionals to fully utilise information gathering due to concerns about breaching patient confidentiality.

The action to be taken for those prisoners where specific concerns regarding self-harm or suicide are identified, but who do not already have a care plan, is unclear from the form.

(2) The nightly roll checks at HMP Belmarsh are due to be carried out by a single member of Operational Support Grade (OSG) staff at 9.00 pm and 6.00 am. Their stated purpose is to check for escape or death among the prisoners. On handing over to the morning staff, the OSG signs paperwork indicating that the roll checks have been completed. There is no robust system by which the prison management audit this process.

Individuals who are the subject of detainment under the Mental Health Act are risk assessed at numerous times. For those that are on Section 17 home leave, they are additionally assessed prior to leaving the ward on each reason. In addition, risks are also reviewed on the regular multi-disciplinary ward rounds. (2) However, such assessments are not centralised in any one place \u2013 there is no central formulation. Reviews by any clinician would have to cover 3 or 4 different entries by way of example: the risk assessment page, the MDT notes, the psychology entries (although they, per se, do not enter risks assessments). (3) The Court\u2019s expert confirmed that such a centralisation\/ formulation (supported by the Route Cause Analysis report), would assist in reviewing an individual\u2019s risk and allowing ward staff to see the wider input in one place. (4) Training has been implemented by the Trust to assist staff in formulating risk, a process that was in place at the time of Claire\u2019s death. However, there is no central repository\/formulation of the outcomes of those assessments. Different teams continue to use different tools; there is no stand-alone document.

the evidence there was some confusion amongst staff as to what was required of them when carrying out observations patients in their rooms. There were different practices adopted by different staff and there appeared to be a custom of not enteriing a patient\u2019s room on the hourly observations so as not to disturb the patients. Sadly because of this practice it was unclear when Christopher had last been seen alive. Whilst the Trust has indicated that all staff have received further training in respect of this I am still not convinved that it is clear as to what is required by staff. b) Following the evidence the Jury concluded:- (a) that during Christopher\u2019s time at Langley Green Hospital no formal review, care plan or adequate risk assessment was carried out in respect of his mental health. (b) that the nursing and clinical records were not kept in accordance with the trust health and record policy. (c) that here was no recorded evidence that any therapeutic engagement has taken place during the period of Christopher\u2019s short stay. Whilst the Trust have indicated that there has been a review of the professional conduct of all staff involved in this case this does not allay my concerns that these practices are limited to just those staff involved in this case. c) Failure to provide staff to accompany a sectioned patient to the emergency department of another Hosptial for treatment for a physical condition.

the inquest the court heard evidence regarding the policies and procedures in place governing requests by informal patients to leave the ACU. The Coroner heard evidence, and accepts, that this is a complex issue in that informal patients are entitled to their liberty whilst at the same time potentially presenting a risk of harming themselves. The Coroner is concerned \u2013 particularly given the complexity of this issue \u2013 that there is no written policy or guidance on it aside from a short paragraph within the Cemetery\u2019s policy governing leave for detainees.d patients. In particular, there appears to be no clear written policy\/procedure on the following: - The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients request to leave the unit; - The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent observations when they request to leave the unit; - The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too high risk to leave the unit; - The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients do leave the unit; - The recording of assessments and decisions relation to requests made by informal patients to leave the unit; - The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. Whilst the inquest into Miss Smith\u2019s death was concerned with the policies in place for informal patients, the Coroner is not aware of a clear timeframe for reporting detained patients either and consideration should be given to introducing a clear timeframe for detained patients as well. Consideration should also be given to ensuring that all staff are fully trained and competent in any new policies and\/or procedures introduced in relation to the matters set out above. 6 During the course of the inquest the court also heard that following Miss Smith\u2019s death SABP carried out a Serious Incident investigation which resulted in the following recommendation, \u2018To develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring and how to manage leave requests during treatment.\u2019 The court heard that a protocol has been developed to manage the medical aspects of alcohol detoxification but does not cover care plans, minimum monitoring or the management of leave request during treatment. It is of concern that these aspects of the recommendation remain outstanding and consideration should be given to implementing them as a matter of urgency. The MATTER OF CONCERN is: 1. There is no clear written policy\/procedure on the following: - The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients request to leave the unit; - The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent observations when they request to leave the unit; - The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too high risk to themselves to leave the unit; - The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients do leave the unit; - The recording of assessments and decisions relation to requests made by informal patients to leave the unit; - The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. 2. There is no clear written policy\/procedure on the following: - The timeframe for reporting detained patients to the police as missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time. 3. Consideration should be given to introducing written policies in relation to the above matters and to ensuring that all staff are fully trained and competent in relation to these matters. 7 4. Consideration should be given to implementing the recommendation arising from the Serious Incident investigation to develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring and how to manage leave requests during treatment. 7 ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to take such action. 8 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 9 COPIES I have sent a copy of this report to the following: 1. Chief Coroner 2. Miss Smith\u2019s family 3.

One of the police officers interviewed the bus driver, who told him that Ms Marchessou had stopped when the bus driver sounded his horn, but then had stepped straight in front of the bus, and after she had been hit had got up and run in front of another bus, only being saved when a passer-by grabbed hold of her. The police officer did not pass on this crucial account to the emergency ambulance crew who transported Ms Marchessou to hospital, nor to any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital. 2. Ms Marchessou told the police officers that she had blacked out and could not remember what had happened, then that she thought she had stepped into the road as the result of a panic attack. She also said that she had stepped in front of the bus because she was upset about being denied contact with her children. The police officers did not pass on the crucial information that Ms Marchessou said she had stepped in front of the bus because she was upset about being denied contact with her children, either to the emergency ambulance crew or to the treating doctors or nurses. 3. The two police officers waited with Ms Marchessou at the hospital for well over two hours, but did not at any point during that time radio police control to ask for any enquiries or searches of police systems to be made. Such information could have been potentially extremely helpful to those treating Ms Marchessou. 4. When the police officers returned to the police station, they did make a search themselves and discovered that she had been arrested for domestic violence. However, they did not make a Merlin record of her potential vulnerability and need for assistance. 3 5. I was provided with a statement from one of the two police officers in advance of the inquest and I called him to give oral evidence on 25 November 2020. When I put to him the sub optimal nature of the way that he had dealt with the incident on 8 July 2020, he did not appear to have undertaken any reflection on this in the intervening four and a half months, nor in the witness box. If there was any error in not passing on information, he attributed this error to his colleague. He did not consider that he had failed to apply a healthy degree of scepticism to Ms Marchessou\u2019s version of events, particularly in the light of the bus driver\u2019s description. He reiterated the view he had formed on the day, that Agn\u00e8s Marchessou being hit by a bus was purely an accident. The police officer defended all of his actions robustly. I could not see that he had learnt anything as a result of these events or that anything about his practice would change in the future. 6. The police officer giving evidence was aware of the view of the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) regarding the failure to create a Merlin, expressed in its report on the police handling of the incident on 8 July, but he seemed very confused about how that should work in practice. If he is confused, even after police have taken him through the DPS report, then other police officers may also be

Paul Hills was an Royal Air Force Firefighter Trainer, had served over 20 years and had completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan. He experienced mental health problems and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and received treatment from DCMH Woolwich a three hour round trip from his home. His treatment continued during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1. No risk assessment was completed on the issue of moving mental health appointments to virtual during the COVID-19 pandemic and how patients could be kept safe in the event of deterioration in his mental health. There was no plan in place for patients that required urgent assessment\/review due to deterioration in their mental health. 2. Care plan had not been updated since October 2019 and his risk assessment remained the same even when the scores changed and there was evidence of escalating risk behaviour. 3. Risk issues were not shared with the family even though Sgt Hills was in lockdown with them and there were no discussions regarding sharing of information. He disclosed his dry runs of self-strangulation on 28th February and 16th April and his withdrawal\/isolation from his family who had been very supportive of him. On 22nd April he disclosed he was looking for a rafter to harm himself from and there was an overreliance on his family as a protective factor in the absence of this knowledge being shared with them. 4. His risk assessment was not up-to-date and his disclosures during April were not documented. 5. Sgt Hills was advised not to drive with his wife and children in the car when he disclosed strong thoughts to drive head long into oncoming traffic. This advice would not have protected Sgt Hills or other road users. 6. Evidence was heard during the inquest that RAF Manston was being decommissioned and this impacted on the treatment available locally for Sgt Hills and impacted on communications with the DCMH and the

oral evidence, I was advised that when an onwards internal referral is made to another clinician within the Priory Group which is then declined this is not communicated directly to the patient if the treatment is funded by way of insurance cover. In those cases a notification would be provided to the insurers or the policyholder and then the Priory Group would not have any further contact with the patient. As such, patients that are considered to be higher risk by the clinician at initial assessment may not therefore have the opportunity to imminently consider alternative sources of treatment or receive any advice as to safety netting in the interim as this information is not being provided by clinicians to the patient. From the evidence that I heard it would be reliant on their insurers or corporate policy holders (who may well not be clinicians) to make contact with the patients to inform them of this during which time their health may have further declined or their risk increased. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe the Priory Group has the power to take such action. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26 December 2020. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner and to the following Interested Persons I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. 8 The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 27 October 2020 9 Signature Joanne Andrews

I please direct your attention to pages 21-23 of the attached summing up. ViST forms. These generate a lot of data about potentially vulnerable individuals. I consider deaths may be prevented in the future where that data could be appropriately shared with partner agencies. I have in mind, in particular, Cornwall Partnership Foundation Trust and Kernow Clinical Commissioning Group (on behalf of GPs.) I recognise there is a need to limit or prioritise the data shared so that it is manageable and targeted to the most vulnerable and\/or those at greatest risk of harm or self-harm. I further recognise that there may well be legitimate concerns about data protection. I was told this may be overcome where a particular individual consents to the sharing of data. Where someone refuses to consent, however, I accept sharing may be more problematic and legal advice may be required. 2 Information Classification: CONTROLLED Information Classification: CONTROLLED Custody Access to CJLDT Assessments and Consideration of Ramifications of Imposing Bail Conditions on Vulnerable Individuals. At his assessment by CJLDT in May 2018, it had been recognised that was a strong protective factor keeping Darrell from harming himself. After his release from custody in July 2018, a bail condition was (correctly) imposed that he was not to contact his wife. This had the unintended consequence of removing that strong protective factor. In the event those in custody had known of the assessment in the CJLDT records, that may have had an influence on assessing Darrell\u2019s risk to himself at the point of release. It may have led to a request to an HCP or CPFT to re-assess Darrell\u2019s risk to himself. It may be that the standard questions completed by custody sergeants could be amended to require an Officer to review or have reviewed any assessment in CJLDT prior to the imposition of a bail

It was the evidence of the author of the EPUT Root Cause Analysis Investigation Report, , that whilst all the other EPUT teams that came into contact with Mr King, such as the Mental Health Liaison Team and the Street Triage Team, used the same software called Mobius with which to record, access and share important information and developments regarding Mr King, one Team, namely the Health and Justice Team did not use this software and instead used software that was incapable of being accessed by the other teams. A consequence of this was that the other teams were wholly unaware of crises and other important information regarding Mr King\u2019s mental health that were known to the Health and Justice Team. (2) Whilst it was the view of the RCA author that in Mr King\u2019s case such an obstacle to the sharing \/ accessing of important information did not have a direct bearing on the outcome for Mr King, she did expressly state, and I share this concern, that there is the potential for the wellbeing and lives of other individuals to be jeopardised where important information and \/ or crises are known to and recorded by the Health and Justice Team but unknown to all the other relevant Teams. There is the potential for the risk of harm to self and others, including death, to be inaccurately assessed and managed where the assessor does not have access to the full picture. (3) The RCA author was not aware as to why the Health and Justice Team had different software to Mobius or why it was not capable of integration with Mobius, but she felt, and I agree, that action

evidence it was heard that Piotr had not received his \u2018depot\u2019 medication for some time and was clearly suffering from a psychotic episode at the time of his assessment at the Accident and Emergency department of the West Suffolk Hospital on the 16th December 2019 Piotr told staff he was not actively suicidal at that point. time, and although the staff were concerned about his presentation, under mental health law least restrictive principles, they did not believe the powers of detention under the Mental Health Act were applicable. That said, it was also clear from the evidence that the mental health personnel who saw Piotr wanted to immediately admit him as an informal patient. It was also clear that when Piotr attended hospital on the 16th December 2019, he too wanted to be immediately admitted as an informal patient. As a result, staff tried to locate a bed for Piotr so he could be admitted as all involved wished. However, it was identified that there were no beds available in Suffolk, or anywhere else in the country at the time. Different options of keeping Piotr in the hospital were explored but none were viable. As such, Piotr was prescribed medication to reduce his immediate anxiety and sent home with a friend, with instructions to return if his symptoms deteriorated. Piotr took his own life the next morning before he could be returned to hospital. Had a bed been available and Piotr had been admitted as he and medical staff had wished on the evening of the 16th December 2019, his death would not have occurred. I am therefore concerned in relation to the overall bed capacity for those patients like Piotr seeking informal admission.

Following his discharge on Friday 24th January 2020, Ms realised that the dose of Amitryptyline and Nitrazepam dispensed was half the usual dose. Mr. Cooney, who had dementia, had been found during his admission to lack capacity and had suffered multifactorial delirium during the admission, did not know why he only had half the expected dose of these medications, he did not recall the change and became anxious about it. It was agreed that they would contact his GP on Monday the 27th January to ask for a review of the medications. As Ms had not been informed of the decision and the reason for it she could not explain it to her father and\/or provide reassurance. Unfortunately, Mr. Cooney ended his life during the early hours of the 27th January. Mr. Cooney\u2019s suicide note included \u201cI tried to sort the tablets out but couldn\u2019t\u201d 2. For patients with a cognitive impairment there is a risk that if changes to medication made during an inpatient stay are not communicated directly to those caring for them, confusion will arise which could result in the medication being erroneously omitted or overdose. 3. Dr. acknowledged that if Mr. Cooney had been a patient on the Geriatric Wards, rather than a plastic surgery patient, she would have communicated the fact and reason for change to Ms. directly. She said she did not do so in this case because, as a Consultant providing an opinion for a patient under the care of another team, she did not view it as her responsibility. 4. Dr. said that her practice had now changed, and she would always communicate such a decision to the NOK of a patient with a cognitive impairment. She was also aware that the facts of this case would be raised with other geriatricians within the Trust. However, it was not clear that this awareness will result in consideration of a new instruction\/procedure that for all patients with dementia and\/or significant cognitive impairment, any changes to medications made during an inpatient stay should be communicated to the NOK\/carer by the clinician making the change regardless of the capacity in which they come to be reviewing the patient. 5. The Coroner is aware that this case has not been the subject of a root cause analysis or similar such investigation and is therefore concerned that the broader implications of this breakdown in

a statement about the training given to police officers in the area of suicide intervention. stated that he had created a training package for new recruits. This training is designed to give first responders pointers to save lives and to buy time. I received further information during the course of the inquest that most new recruits of Sussex Police in the last 12-18 months had received the training. However this training is not being rolled out to the remainder of the police force. The concern I have is that training specifically designed to save lives is not being provided to all front line staff.

When he had first illegally entered the UK Mr Mustafa was deported to Italy on 29\/10\/18. Just before he was deported he confirmed he would kill himself if he was deported. He was provided with 1:1 constant watch and was successfully deported. When he re-entered the UK on 30\/01\/19 he was seen by a member of the immigrationn compliance and enforcement team who completed paperwork for the national asylum accommodation unit who in turn completed a service commission form requesting initial accommodation. The service commission form recorded that he had urgent medical needs and was a safeguarding concern however no detail was provided. Neither G4S nor Urban housing services requested any further details. A system needs to be put in place to ensure organisations provide sufficient details for providers to understand the nature of safeguarding concerns and health care matters. If there are GDPR concerns these could easily be addressed by a consent form at the time the person is first seen. 2.

Nursing staff and Health Care Assistants on Westleigh Ward at Atherleigh Park Hospital were carrying out (and continue to carry out) observations of patients at precise intervals (for example, if a patient is on half-hourly observations, staff explained that they would aim to carry out observations at 10.00 am, 10.30 a.m., 11 am etc.). Further, all records showed that the timings of observations were at precise intervals. This is not in accordance with the Trust\u2019s policy of observations (which confirms that observations should be irregular but within the (e.g. 30 minute) window. The reason for this policy is clearly to avoid a situation whereby a patient can predict when they will next be observed (and offer an opportunity for the patient to take action to harm herself during that period of time). 2. The Deputy Ward Manager on Westleigh Ward at Atherleigh Park Hospital confirmed that she did not and still does not check that observations by staff are being carried out in accordance with the Trust policy, despite accepting that this was her role when the nurse in charge of a shift. Further, the Deputy Manager of Westleigh Ward did not understand the Policy and thought that observations were to be carried out at regular intervals (as referred to above). 3. The Trust carried out an investigation following the death of Lauren. It was of concern that the lead investigator (who gave evidence at the inquest) did not understand the Observation Policy and suggested that observations should be carried out at irregular intervals (which was correct) but then gave an example of 10 minute observations being carried out at: 10 am, 10.08 am, 10.20 am (which is clearly not in accordance with the Policy). The interval should never exceed the 10 minute period (and there is 12 minutes between 10.08 am and 10.20 am). 4. There were examples in the records of nursing staff putting in entries 24 hours after the event had occurred. Whilst it is accepted that nursing staff may, on occasion, need to wait some time before marking an entry into the clinical record, a period of 24 hours when dealing with patients at risk of self-harm

Mr Ashley\u2019s Care and Treatment Plan was not updated when his mental health deteriorated.\n2. Staff were not recording interactions with Mr Ashley in the CareNotes system and often emails were not copied into these notes. Therefore there was a lack of compilation of key information relating to Mr Ashley.\n3. There was no system in place for Lead Practioners to be notified of an important entry in a patient\u2019s CareNotes where action was required. 4. Mr Ashley had not been seen by a Psychiatrist for over a year and there was no evidence that the deterioration of his mental health (and his non compliance with his medication) had been reviewed by the professionals weekly team meetings. 5. The Inquest identified that there was a discrepanciy in the Trust\u2019s own Policies as to when a Risk Assesment should be reviewed. 6. Save for the duty scheme there appears to be no procedure in place for another practictioner to cover a Lead Practictioner\u2019s case load or any formal handover when they are on leave. Therefore there was no single person who has uptodate knowledge of a patient who may be in need or whose mental health was deteriorating. 7. The Inquest heard evidence that the Liasion Mental Health Team at the Hosptial did not make use of patient\u2019s Care and Support Plans or Central Risk Assessment. 8. The was no clear procedure for GPs to be updated by Care Coordinators with details of a patient\u2019s current treatment plan if it had been changed.

The findings of the internal investigation by Oxleas NHS were that the assessment undertaken by the Community Mental Health Nurse did not illicit sufficient information to enable the multidisciplinary team to properly review Mr Jenkins\u2019 mental health. Despite this the multi-disciplinary team proceeded with a review and decided that he did not have a mental health condition, without seeking a further assessment (2) The Community Mental Health Nurse did not document her formulation or impression. The plan moving forward was not robust and did not explore protective factors or minimisation of harm and there was an over-reliance on alcohol and drug use as the cause of his suicidal ideation. There appeared to be no proforma of questions to ask. (3) As a direct consequence of the limited information gathering Billy Jenkins was not properly assessed and it was not known whether he had a mental health diagnosis which required treatment.

Although it was recorded on System 1 that Mr Weeks had recently attempted suicide in another prison shortly before his admission to HMP Cardiff no member of Healthcare staff checked the medical records and further that although the GP records which were sent to the prison confirmed that Mr Weeks was prescribed anti-depressants in the community no member of Healthcare staff noticed this and as a consequence Mr Weeks was not given anti-depressants in HMP Cardiff. The Healthcare witnesses, including the Head of Healthcare, indicated that a red flag for suicide or self-harm would be of great value for staff who because of insufficient staff and a heavy workload did not have time to review the System 1 record in any or any sufficient detail. Further it was considered that all System 1 records should be reviewed when an individual is admitted into the prison and that there should be in place a process for doing so. 6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action. 7. YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 May 2020. I, the Coroner, may extend the period upon request. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8. COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the family who may find it useful or of interest. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 12th March 2020 SIGNED: Geraint Williams

The Inquest focused upon the response of the emergency services \u2010 SWP, WAST & CTMUHB Mental Health Nurse, to the earlier suicidal episode. Evidence was received from amongst others, of SWP, \u2013 paramedic from WAST & Mental Health Nurse, regarding their involvement with DL. gave evidence as to his interpretation of s136 Mental Health Act 1983(MHA). In particular, whether he believed that the power to remove DL arose in the particular circumstances he was presented with on the evening of 28.3.19. In summary, his interpretation of s136 was that, even if he had been satisfied that DL was suffering from a mental disorder & in immediate need of care, or control, the power to detain would not have been available to him, due to the exclusion in s136(1A). His interpretation of that sub\u2010section was that as DL had paid for the hotel room in which she was staying, that was a room in which she was living. Regard was had during the Inquest as to the Department of Health Guidance to the changes to the MHA 1983, published in October 2017. No specific guidance as to the classification of a hotel room for the purposes of whether that falls within the exception in s136 (1A) is provided. Whilst it is accepted, both by myself, & in the Guidance, as above, that there will always be some degree of discretion for a police officer to exercise in relation to the interpretation of whether a person is living in a hotel room, the evidence here was that DL had booked into the room for one night & had no more than a bare licence to occupy it (which would contrast with, for example, an individual or family temporarily housed in a hotel room by a local authority, or a care home resident occupying indefinitely a room in a care home). Hence, based upon the evidence I received, and my interpretation (in these particular circumstances) of whether a hotel room came within s136 (1A) MHA, I found it likely that did have the power to remove DL to a place of safety My concern is that faced with a similar situation (albeit in circumstances were the officer did consider a person was suffering from mental disorder and requiring of immediate care, or control), an officer may reach the same conclusion as determine the power to remove did not exist, and this may lead to a risk of death to that individual. I would emphasise that whilst I interpreted s136 MHA as likely to afford the power to remove DL on the night in question, I found his assessment of DL to be a reasonable one, and that the grounds to remove her did not exist as she was not in immediate need of care, or control. (2) I consider that it is necessary for the police to consider their interpretation of whether a hotel room falls within the exception provided for by s136 (1A) MHA, and to provide clear guidance, and instruction to officers faced with exercising their powers under s136 MHA in circumstances were an individual presents with suffering from mental disorder, is requiring of immediate care or control

the course of hearing an inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court on 9\/10\/19 into the death of Julius Jake Little, evidence was considered in relation to available support services offered to undergraduates at UAL who have a history of mental health problems. The Dean of Students at UAL , gave 3 evidence that applicants to UAL make an online application to the admissions organisation UCAS. The application invites them to disclose any history they have of mental health problems, upon being accepted on a course of study this information is provided to the admitting university. indicated that the mental health disclosure information is used to target students that may require support, and at UAL emails are sent to undergraduates, inviting them to register with the university's support services. Regrettably, it would appear that of UAL's cohort of students that disclosed mental health problems to UCAS, only 66% of undergraduates responded to the email invitation offering mental health support. The remaining 33%, a total of some 200 students, did not respond to the offer. I asked whether the identity of students who had made a mental health disclosure in their UCAS application was communicated to tutors and halls of residence staff at the university.

1,-0.0647002608,0.0465393066,-0.0560230911]],["1. There was a delay in organising the assessment of Mr Dundhal when he was detained on S5(2) of the Mental Health Act on 11\/04\/19. The evidence confirmed there appeared to be confusion as to who was to undertake the assessment between Walsall MBC and Birmingham City Council. In addition there was a lack of resources to enable the assessment to be carried out in a timely manner. This meant the assessment was carried out just a few hours before the time period for the S5(2) was to expire. 2. Evidence at the inquest from the approved Mental health practitioner confirmed that key information and documentation were either unavailable and\/or not asked for during the mental health act assessment on 14\/04\/19. I was unable to confirm which at the inquest. This meant the true nature of Mr Dundhal\u2019s long term condition was not known and the assessors were unable to see the \u201cbigger picture\u201d. The delay in arranging the assessment contributed to the lack of available information. 3. When Mr Dundhal was admitted to hospital on 15\/03\/19 he was placed on S2 of the Mental Health Act when his clinical team had specifically recommended he be placed on S3. No explanation was available for this. Evidence at the inquest suggested this was a decision made by the Approved Mental health practitioner from Birmingham City Council. Consideration needs to given as to why a S3 was not put in place in accordance with the recommendation. 4. Walsall MBC has failed to undertake an internal investigation into the delays and resources concerns during the assessment in April 19. They have also failed to engage with other agencies to ensure lessons are learnt.

I heard evidence at the inquest that this call was graded incorrectly. It should have been graded as a P2 call with a response time within 60minutes. I also heard evidence to confirm that the large number of P1 calls that that evening meant that even if the call had been correctly graded it would not have been answered as all available resources were required for the P1 calls (15 minutes response). The evidence confirmed that nearly all the P2 and P3 calls went unanswered that night. This raises a serious concern about the amount of resources available to West Midlands Police.

Evidence was given during the inquest by SBP staff on the ward concerned, that the reason SBP staff did not arrange to collect Sasha and return her to the ward when her s.17 leave had been revoked, was that they did not have the resources to allow them to do this, despite it being their ;legal responsibility so to do. (2)) Sasha\u2019s mother gave evidence that SBP\u2019s reliance on her bringing Sasha back to the ward when s.17 leave had been revoked, placed an unfair and intolerable burden on her, in circumstances when she and the rest of the family were struggling to keep Sasha safe. Knowing that SBP would not send someone out to collect Sasha made her feel that she had no choice but to agree to their request. (3) The last such occasion when SBP staff on the ward decided that Sasha\u2019s s.17 leave should be revoked was on the afternoon of her death on 31.3.17. Although formal revocation of leave was never finalised, Sasha\u2019s mother was given to believe that it would be, and again reluctantly agreed to bring Sasha back to the ward.

You have a duty under the Railway Safety (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 1997 to prevent access to the railway line so far as is reasonably practicable. (2) The fencing at the scene of Mr Key\u2019s death was a low wooden fence which was easy to climb over. (3) The British Transport Police (BTP) report into the death, reference CRU 2018 1711 & BTP 404\u201014091, of which you received a copy, recommended replacing the fence and gate with a heightened palisade gate and fence. I agree with that recommendation. (4) Trains regularly travel on this section of the track at speeds of 125 mph. (5) Children and adults would, like Mr Key, be able to climb the wooden fence and be at risk of injury or death on the track from passing trains. (6) It would be reasonably practicable for you to fence the track at this point in the way suggested in the BTP Report. ##DW<<corAddress>> Tel ##DW<<corTel>> | Fax

Dr Drew worked alone, putting herself and members of the public, for whom she had medical responsibility, at potential significant risk.",["recruitment","process","appointment","doctor","position","significant","responsibility","access","anaesthetic","drugs","completely","inadequate","none","appears","known","dr","drew","appointed","dr","drew","worked","alone","putting","members","public","medical","responsibility","potential","significant","risk"],["recruitment","process","appointment","doctor","position","significant","responsibility","access","anaesthetic","drug","completely","inadequate","none","appear","know","dr","drew","appoint","dr","draw","worked","alone","put","member","public","medical","responsibility","potential","significant","risk"],[-0.0533973426,0.0252454039,0.0284710582,0.0277383737,-0.075167954,-0.0142255323,0.0346627086,-0.1218135431,0.099849306,0.019364981,-0.0045697442,-0.0902983546,-0.0074562863,0.0045755319,-0.1353878081,0.1149355099,0.0362296253,0.0501313061,0.0060230782,-0.0303881411,-0.0077125286,-0.0336966664,-0.0054784315,0.1084536836,0.0410029963,-0.0342157297,-0.1224617809,0.0337966383,-0.0490291193,-0.0378007554,0.0224840883,-0.0258531235,-0.0494826734,-0.0386494622,-0.0037302477,-0.0180739705,0.0727265477,0.0750637725,-0.0062171672,-0.0365989953,0.0541529171,-0.0447295606,0.0164247714,-0.0418701172,-0.067197606,-0.1120416075,-0.0425688662,0.0048680799,-0.0699999556,-0.0285518244,-0.0131493928,-0.0022340971,-0.0577116348,-0.0374071859,-0.0318966582,-0.0053929295,-0.0571457446,-0.0316698812,0.0274195187,-0.0624502786,-0.0723087713,0.0876991004,-0.0813409239,-0.0157807451,-0.0195817612,-0.0088327341,-0.0160480365,0.1302921623,-0.0877938122,0.0197038315,0.01171875,0.0206590854,0.0967491418,0.0088379961,-0.1308940947,-0.052522067,0.0537130423,0.082376942,0.0635628551,0.1233575791,0.0227266513,-0.0132609401,0.0250854492,0.0227661133,-0.0040356866,-0.0981924087,-0.0806463808,0.0264724214,-0.0090637207,-0.0357929096,0.160370931,-0.0645625666,0.0036855238,-0.0473962314,0.0343280658,-0.049592115,-0.0189124793,0.0600896366,0.0614918694,0.01779701,-0.0399896018,-0.0486329161,0.0099855624,0.0348426551,0.0182216242,-0.069838427,-0.0327769294,-0.0616781302,0.1020155251,-0.0636765063,-0.0073578935,-0.0334325321,-0.0593956262,-0.0573930405,0.0832487941,-0.0370659679,0.0202105287,-0.0470181182,0.128537938,0.0460194573,-0.1235688329,0.0001257535,-0.0685833916,0.0996956676,-0.0113593796,0.0047607422,-0.0107905949,-0.0690376014,0.0819838941,0.0756730735,-0.0004293508,-0.0854471177,-0.0932869762,0.0163858347,0.0137886833,-0.0766559467,-0.0057204673,0.0639480054,0.0157323368,0.0542581491,0.0078782709,-0.0356355868,-0.0032468007,0.0070711332,-0.0581938662,0.0377607681,0.0044087376,0.0047881026,-0.0618475564,0.0010775862,0.0909550115,-0.0075588883,-0.0510480143,0.0373892933,0.0162437707,-0.0441568308,-0.0379638672,-0.1009311005,-0.0753400102,-0.0226915292,0.0594592914,0.056522239,0.0616244599,-0.0034011314,0.0030770137,-0.0703167096,0.0106306402,-0.0786848366,0.0318182595,-0.0587926395,-0.0190861151,0.0023140742,-0.0307769775,-0.1345256865,0.0220996682,-0.0719041526,0.0893738866,-0.090795055,-0.0245171916,0.0057625608,-0.095872812,-0.0438737534,-0.0174721032,-0.03642115,-0.0505476333,0.015100413,-0.0322497152,0.0127652921,0.0478473529,0.0666230321,-0.0219306611,-0.0184652396,-0.003759976,0.0250938684,-0.0428451002,0.0144391553,0.0140359811,-0.0345490538,0.0159827918,-0.1150091738,-0.0285778698,0.1467390358,0.0344155394,-0.1114123091,-0.0053390632,-0.058353819,0.0272695608,-0.0274005756,0.0332788937,-0.0285994429,-0.0126953125,0.0153934872,-0.0882868245,0.0159554314,-0.0733904317,-0.045267038,0.0443451963,-0.0348784365,-0.0530469157,-0.0817429125,0.0020246834,-0.0021972656,0.0295397006,0.0419164188,0.09160956,-0.0672207549,0.0696237534,-0.0108810952,0.0120815411,0.02907799,0.0455911569,-0.0048901788,0.0177001953,-0.013706076,0.0119923558,-0.0282861125,0.0511474609,-0.0342975482,0.0564932972,-0.0373516753,0.0156839304,-0.0180965289,0.0184851028,-0.0894617513,-0.0232294016,0.0499793738,0.0227366481,0.0835650191,0.004501869,-0.043047674,-0.0093173319,0.009530955,-0.0019636482,0.0499104485,0.0640700758,0.0677974299,0.0278701782,0.0752374083,-0.0373282582,0.0043461239,0.0014059133,-0.0325433128,0.0032390726,0.0607950278,0.0373606198,0.0963693783,-0.0011786099,0.0008718556,-0.1609833837,-0.0624789521,0.0618133545,0.0779271647,0.0655054525,0.032185521,0.0077355155,-0.0561860166,-0.0591872633,-0.1022570357,-0.0186751802,0.0383416526,0.0155057581,-0.0012922615,0.0310631003,0.0745518133,-0.014496902,0.0343393795,-0.0438660085,0.0055905045,0.0610519946,-0.0494384766,-0.0552578643,0.034457501,-0.0814924538,0.0729096532,-0.0895869806,0.0619317405,0.0029452094,-0.0246818811,-0.0104096513,-0.0265208278]],["1. The deceased suffered from emotional unstable personality disorder and was in crisis for most of 2018. The recommended treatment for his condition was psychological therapy. He had not had any psychological input since 2010. The inquest heard that whilst he was under the care of the home treatment team there was no access to psychology services. He had to be under the community mental health team to be able to access psychological services. There were periods when he was under the care of the community mental health team but at this time he remained on a long waiting list for psychological services. Throughout 2018 he never received any psychological services. I am concerned that the main treatment option for the deceased was not available to him due to internal structures and long waiting lists. 2. In August 2018 the deceased required inpatient treatment. There were no beds available and as a result he had further episodes of self-harm and suicide attempts.

Mr Watson was aged 72. The Community Mental Health Team advised on 18\/10\/18 that he required an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment for his own safety. However, this could not happen as no bed was available within the area. Three days later there was still no bed available. Mr Watson was not offered a bed out-of-area. 2. This report has similar themes to the 7 reports issued by the Birmingham and Solihull Coroners on 4\/10\/18. 3. However, the impact of Mr Watson\u2019s age is a new issue. 4. I heard evidence that: a. Younger and older adults will not normally be admitted as inpatients on mixed units. Beds on young adult units may have been available on 18-22 October 2018 but these were not considered. b. Beds in neighbouring areas are unavailable because of contractual issues. The closest out of area option is at least 70 miles away. Although Mr Watson was not offered an out of area bed, his wife was confident that had one been offered he would have declined because 70 miles was so far away. Whilst this distance is likely to deter a patient of any age from accepting the offer, it is particularly problematic for elderly patients and their families. c. Whilst remedial action is underway in response to the concerns raised in the 7 reports issued on 4\/10\/18, currently it still remains the position that at least one patient every day in Birmingham and Solihull is advised they require an immediate admission for inpatient mental health treatment but no bed is available within the area. 5. The lack of inpatient beds is a resource issue.

Natalie HUNTER\u2019s GP, gave live meant about Miss HUNTER\u2019s 18 previous serious attempts to take her life. During the course of his evidence he referred to the lack of Discharge Summaries from the Isle of Wight NHS Trust. He said it is not uncommon for a Discharge Summary not to be sent to a GP\u2019s practice by the IOW NHS Trust.Trust, or if it is sent, for it to be sent very late after the patient has been discharged from the Trust. 2. raised concerns about this as the Discharge Summary should contain details of why the patient was admitted; what care they received during their time at the IOW NHS Trust; what medication they were prescribed, and whether such medication was intended to be continued; and whether there were going to require ongoing care\/treatment as a result of this admission\/treatment. 3. If no Discharge Summary is received, it has a big impact on the care that GPs are able to offer to their patients and the continuity of care which is needed, particularly in relation to mental health input. 4. On several occasions, had been unaware of the nature of the admissions (which were almost all linked to her serious suicidal attempts) \u2013 and 3 significantly the ongoing risk of further attempts on Miss HUNTER\u2019s life as he had either not received a Discharge Summary or had received it too late for it to have any meaningful input into Miss HUNTER\u2019s care. 5. During the course of the live evidence I heard from , Service Manager for Community Mental Health Services at the Isle of Wight NHS Trust, in connection with the lack of sufficient numbers of out-of-hours mental health or Crisis staff which are available across the Isle of Wight. His evidence (which has since been supplemented by up-to-date figures), was that the team currently comprises of 11.1 full-time equivalent Band 6 mental health staff members, but it really requires 15.74 full-time equivalent appropriately qualified staff members which would necessitate 4.64 full-time equivalent additional staff to be funded and recruited in order to be able to offer a full and effective service. 6. The evidence was that there are currently insufficient funds in order for a full complement of out-of-hours mental health\/Crisis staff to be deployed which is affecting the way in which the Mental Health service operates and delivers care to those who need it out-of-hours. 7.

There is confusion surrounding the meaning of the following question from NHS England\u2019s national clinical category for in possession Risk Assessments in the Secure Estate: \u201cHave you had problems in the last 6 months with not taking, or not remembering to take your medicines as prescribed?\u201d The Risk Assessment had not been used in the assessment for Mr. Delahaye\u2019s in possession modification on the 29th January 2018 when it ought to have been. However, during the course of considering what the outcome would have been if the risk assessment had been undertaken, more than one clinician interpreted the question as pertaining only to consideration of incidents where medication had not been taken. It was the Coroner\u2019s view that the question is also asking about incidents where medication may have been taken but not \u201cas prescribed\u201d thus encompassing an overdose (accidental or deliberate). The question is not clear and this creates a risk that the score generated may be incorrect and in possession medication may be authorised where it ought not to be, putting lives at risk. 2. During the inquest it emerged that the mental health nurse who assessed Mr. Delahaye on the 2nd January 2018 and the GP who assessed him for in possession medication on the 29th January 2018, had not identified from his notes all relevant past medical conditions. It emerged that whilst the System One records (a case management system used across the prison estate) has the facility to provide a summary of significant past and current medical conditions, it is not reliable at HMP Birmingham because conditions are not consistently given the correct \u2018read code\u2019. Evidence from the NHS England clinical reviewer, , was that this problem is not unique to HMP Birmingham and is found in other prison healthcare teams and requires a change of culture and practice to bring the system for read coding into line with that in the community. The absence of a reliable source for quickly identifying relevant past and current medical conditions puts lives at risk from misinformed decision making. 3. No member of the healthcare team was present at any of Mr. Delahaye\u2019s ACCT reviews. It was identified during the inquest that a member of either the mental health team, primary care or the drug\/alcohol service ought to have been present at the first review at least. It was the evidence of a first line manager who had involvement in the ACCT that a member of the custodial team had contacted healthcare and asked them to attend but this was not documented and the healthcare team maintained they were unaware of the date of the first review. Whilst the ACCT book provides a checklist of actions to be undertaken at various times it does not include making healthcare aware of the first review. As this is a national Ministry of Justice form, HMP Birmingham can\u2019t change it but a failure to inform healthcare of an ACCT review could result in useful knowledge or expertise not being available to the ACCT team and could put lives at risk. 4. On the morning of the 5th March 2018 Mr. Delahaye\u2019s cell had been unlocked at approximately 07:50. It is likely that he was already dead at this time (and had been so for some hours) but he was not found because the prison custody officer who unlocked his cell did not look into the cell or seek any kind of acknowledgement from Mr. Delahaye. It was acknowledged by the relevant PCO and by the Safer Custody Manager that unlock ought to have involved a welfare check. The Safer Custody Manager\u2019s evidence is that the need for a welfare check on unlock has been emphasised to senior managers and leads through a bilateral document covered at formal briefings. However, it was not clear how this is then communicated down to the individual custody officers and how they are being audited to make sure they are conducting a welfare check on unlock.

October 2016 Davy was referred by his GP to the community mental health team (CMHT), part of Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (CPT) for assessment of possible \u2018Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\u2019 (ADHD) which is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.Davy was assessed in December 2016 by CMHT. However, Davy was discharged from CMHT without further diagnosis and treatment. This was because of the following reasons;- 1) CPT is not commissioned to assess, diagnose or treat adult ADHD. 2) Addaction Cornwall does not have access to a specialist psychiatrist with the skills to diagnose or treat ADHD. 3) Although the GP had the option to refer under Patient Choice for treatment out of county, the GPs previous experience indicated that this was impracticable because it would not be possible to successfully deliver the ongoing oversight and review of medication.

service.",["evidence","mr","viswambaran","gp","transpired","waiting","time","iapt","therapy","region","weeks","could","weeks","concerned","individuals","may","experience","deterioration","mental","health","pending","appointment","disengage","mental","health","services","due","length","waiting","times","therapy","mr","viswambaran","problems","making","contact","iapt","team","telephone","order","arrange","initial","triage","telephone","call","concerned","may","discourage","people","pursuing","assistance","service"],["evidence","mr","viswambaran","gp","transpire","waiting","time","iapt","therapy","region","week","could","week","concerned","individual","may","experience","deterioration","mental","health","pending","appointment","disengage","mental","health","service","due","length","wait","time","therapy","mr","viswambaran","problem","make","contact","iapt","team","telephone","order","arrange","initial","triage","telephone","call","concern","may","discourage","people","pursue","assistance","service"],[-0.0243250523,0.0533625297,0.0092938738,0.0540733337,-0.0597661324,0.0219103489,0.0605576821,-0.086363472,0.0843359604,0.0023543041,-0.0344111137,-0.0885785446,-0.0196596775,0.059923809,-0.0337193795,0.1112594604,0.0807202682,0.0784536973,-0.0003703833,-0.0669660568,0.0223331451,0.001343588,0.0124543505,0.0453389473,-0.0250740051,-0.0313920975,-0.1012153625,0.0339953117,0.0196584072,-0.0244102478,0.0343003273,-0.0323025398,-0.07447052,-0.0961049423,-0.0413449593,-0.0257177353,0.0206542015,-0.0117441816,0.0123125715,-0.0032412212,0.0147997541,-0.0174204502,0.0497226715,-0.0410143547,-0.0600236244,-0.0831461921,-0.0124816895,0.0019488335,-0.0879872665,0.0066055059,0.0077401004,-0.0036068361,-0.0557479858,0.0406792946,0.0181121826,0.0498606376,-0.0630426407,-0.0246779528,-0.0013477007,-0.0896603242,-0.1021564826,0.0539592095,-0.0202713013,-0.0348841362,-0.0212249756,0.0447336845,-0.0658009872,0.0991052017,-0.0578166656,0.0178152714,0.0321311168,-0.0098546343,0.1093680039,0.0576965027,-0.1092534065,-0.0766580105,0.0338118859,0.0755106583,0.0598526001,0.0984217301,0.0256420765,-0.0116795702,0.0178400669,0.018196106,0.0344467163,-0.0296963062,-0.0982260332,0.0703655854,0.0163180027,0.0200773869,0.159488678,-0.0103336973,-0.0325376205,-0.0795275345,0.0271759033,-0.0716946945,0.0717671737,0.0283508301,0.0333792381,-0.0173835754,0.0402899198,-0.0218378697,0.034614563,0.0382321663,-0.0004293919,-0.0546734333,-0.0083540278,-0.0381034203,0.0673247948,-0.0252797212,-0.0240650177,-0.0379616432,0.0092816949,-0.0486863442,0.0182275772,0.0044809976,0.0186265316,-0.0557914563,0.121674858,0.077486515,-0.1075286865,0.0405912399,-0.0699965134,0.0661346093,-0.018393198,-0.0380722694,-0.0926766396,0.0023585956,0.0534029007,0.0990234986,-0.0236053467,-0.0967686996,-0.0641212463,-0.0746892318,-0.0369478874,-0.1311165541,0.0120429993,0.0377655029,-0.0032122533,0.0968323946,0.0608903579,-0.0588212013,-0.042963028,0.0523188896,0.0041793189,0.0290145874,-0.066650711,-0.0659554824,-0.1018253937,-0.029182395,0.1443648338,0.0289599095,-0.0679531097,0.0365765877,0.0276985168,-0.0829410553,-0.0133736925,-0.0426972695,-0.0982224122,-0.0262502041,0.0132385893,0.078451477,0.0010948181,-0.0163853969,0.0032374065,-0.0692081451,0.0371163674,-0.0556693077,0.0756529197,-0.0154997511,0.0024110477,-0.041228611,-0.0416094474,-0.0899225846,0.0022951763,-0.0594914742,0.0982195511,-0.0461934395,-0.0623874664,0.0058671036,-0.087439619,-0.0302931461,-0.0010414124,-0.0211607609,-0.0183515549,-0.0082667666,-0.0316486359,0.0123291016,0.0390879326,0.0619087219,0.0043487549,-0.0134347277,-0.0159695949,0.0366713218,0.0117257433,0.0123163862,0.0172576904,-0.0227127075,-0.0323762111,-0.0664639473,-0.0073309541,0.1148430482,-0.0613164902,-0.037771862,0.0187683105,-0.0764605179,-0.0127538042,0.0065031052,0.0485431366,-0.0254742298,-0.0266189575,-0.032875061,-0.0861676112,0.0203018188,-0.0661532059,-0.0273170471,0.059923809,-0.0248780251,-0.1037737504,-0.0256945286,-0.021522522,-0.0199458208,0.0054607391,0.0084820986,0.0438639335,-0.0698091164,0.0493520088,0.0338137932,-0.0340620689,0.0319252014,0.0575885773,-0.0421191864,-0.0130605698,-0.0499709435,0.0335057564,-0.0283088684,0.0544230156,-0.0599072762,0.0175272617,-0.0439758301,0.0422814675,0.0472714119,0.0464045219,-0.0647814274,0.0500063896,0.011592865,0.0043021836,0.0364089012,0.0699132308,-0.0948956832,0.0170294438,0.0294799805,0.0448951721,0.0340245552,0.0393845253,-0.0394694023,0.0720387325,0.0037384033,-0.041724842,0.023743948,-0.0157279968,-0.0305560436,-0.0740458146,0.0328810997,0.0566673279,0.0955429077,0.0282395687,-0.0157187786,-0.0617973022,-0.0600179024,0.0654881001,0.1152706146,0.1239751205,-0.0040734611,0.023651123,-0.0485517196,-0.0292275753,-0.0630652085,-0.0081936521,0.0102005005,0.0105438232,-0.0280431118,0.0966337547,0.0155169172,-0.023869833,-0.0148900347,-0.0109658241,0.0323594399,0.0628255233,0.0351594277,-0.0904733315,0.079744339,-0.0617904663,-0.0221454296,0.0222218838,0.0347284488,-0.0463816337,-

Care, Risk and Crisis Management plans were not robust enough and failed to contain sufficient information. 2. Staff had insufficient perfect knowledge of how to access, interrogate and effectively use computerised medical records, in respect of a generic system which itself did not sufficiently cater for the particular requirementsof Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust.

There was a lack of involvement of family members and in particular, the concept of a triangle of care which involved family, the patient and the medical team had largely been ignored. 4. There did not appear to be a system of peer review within the mental health teams nor a system of external audit as regards the adequacy of care plans and medical records. 5. Unqualified staff were relied upon in circumstances where qualified staff should have been assigned. 6. There appeared to be deficiencies in the supervision of unqualified mental health workers. 7. There was little evidence of multi-disciplinary working in relation to an individual with complex mental health needs. 8. When there was a change in personnel responsible for the care of the patient, there appeared to be a lack of a proper handover between the healthcare professionals. 9. Much of the above implied serious gaps in the adequacy of training \/ knowledge, the allocation of time, the acquisition and deployment of necessary skills and the establishment of satisfactory ways of working. 10. The on-call rota for duty consultants meant that consultant psychiatrists on occasions faced a full day of clinical work immediately following the completion of a 12 hour night time duty, without any

to discuss Mr Tidey\u2019s case and it was agreed he required follow-up, though he was discharged the same day.Team to discuss referring him to the service. Mr Tidey was then re-assessed by the same member of the CLDS who stated he appeared calmer and was no immediate risk to himself. No notes were recorded on the Police or Mental Health Service computer system to record how this assessment of reduced risk of self-harm had been reached. During the following months, no contact was made by mental health services with Mr Tidey, and he did not seek their assistance. On 26th October 2016 he attended Guildford Police Station to be charged with the offences and was assessed by Police and a member of the CLDS as being at low risk of harm to self. On Friday 16th December 2016, Police were made aware that Mr Tidey had lost his job as a consequence of being charged with the offences and therefore that one of the contingent events highlighted in the MASH referral of 3.2.2016 as placing Mr Tidey at higher risk of self-harm had materialised. They therefore completed a further MASH referral form and this was emailed to the MASH hub at 15.40 and forwarded on to Waverley CMHRS at 16.41. On Monday 19th December 2016 at 11.30am, Waverley CMHRS forwarded the MASH report to Guildford CMHRS, but then emailed again at 11.36am to state they noted Waverley CMHRS should actually follow up Mr Tidey. However, for reasons, which cannot be ascertained, no further action was taken. It is not possible to ascertain who the duty 3 RT4563 worker was who received the referral by email. , Community Services Manager for South West Community Mental Health Recovery Service, stated in evidence that had he received Mr Tidey\u2019s MASH referral on 16th December 2016, he would have taken action the same day, initially via a telephone triage assessment and then via the options available of HTT referral; EDT Mental Health Act Assessment, crisis planning with safe havens or CMHRS non-crisis support, as appropriate. Evidence was given that there were no safeguards in place to check referrals were being acted upon, and that this remains the case. Mr Tidey was found deceased on 22nd December 2016, the day before he was due to attend Court for sentencing. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are: - How MASH reports are processed by the MASH team upon receipt; - Whether there is an effective system in place to ensure that MASH reports are followed up by the appropriate Community Mental Health Team (where necessary); and - Whether there is an effective system in place to deal appropriately with MASH referrals received outside normal weekday office hours, and that those completing the MASH referral forms (e.g. Police officers) know where these should be send outside normal working hours when a high risk is identified Consideration should be given to

was apparent from the evidence that there were five principal failures by the proactive challenges in addressing the issues identified. These challenges include: (1) The Deceased was first assessed by the Trust\u2019s Early Intervention and Assertive Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of psychiatric treatment and care by another team but, despite referring her on to other psychiatric teams within the Trust, made no effective transfer of her care before discharging her back to her General Practitioner and closing her case. A significant number of clinical and managerial staff were involved in this process and none of them prevented the Deceased\u2019s premature discharge. (2) Prior to the Deceased\u2019s discharge no sufficient assessment was made of her risk of suicide. Despite at least two clinical staff being involved, there was insufficient evidence gathering, including from the Deceased\u2019s family, and a wholly inadequate assessment was made despite the use of the Trust\u2019s electronic assessment tool (which was not properly completed). Further, no plan was put in place to manage the Deceased\u2019s recognised risk of suicide. (3) Prior to the Deceased\u2019s discharge no care plan was put in place and no single person had responsibility for ensuring her care was properly assessed, co-ordinated and delivered prior to discharge. (4) The Deceased was discharged back to the care of her General Practitioner with a recommendation for the prescription of psychiatric medication without her having been seen or assessed by the psychiatrist who made the recommendation and with no means of monitoring its subsequent effectiveness. (5) Despite the matters set out in (1) to (4), the General Practitioner\u2019s request, made on 15 March 2016, for an urgent assessment was not granted and the Trust\u2019s Access and Assessment Team provided an appointment for a date five weeks later on 20 April 2016. I was told by witnesses from the Trust (and in submissions made on behalf of the Trust) that the Trust had adequate relevant policies and procedures in place at the time and that the failings set out above occurred because all the staff involved failed to follow those policies and procedures. It was said that there has been no subsequent amendment of the policies and procedures but, in summary, that staff have been reminded of them and what ought to happen (by email) and there is now an increased level of monitoring of compliance. Whilst the staff directly involved, who gave oral evidence at the inquest, told me that they now understand that the above failings ought not to have happened and would not occur now, I remain concerned that one or more of the above failings could recur in the future. Although the Trust has taken steps to inform current staff of what went wrong in the Deceased\u2019s case, it has not taken steps to ensure that the above failings could not occur again (whether by amendment or clarification of its policies and\/or procedures or sufficient training of staff or otherwise). Most particularly, the evidence provided to me did not satisfy me that the Trust\u2019s policies and procedures, and the training given upon them, now ensure that every patient who is referred to the Trust will be assessed and treated in a timely manner, even if transfer between teams is necessary. Nor did it satisfy me that every patient\u2019s risk of suicide is now properly assessed and managed so as to ensure the risk is minimised. In all the circumstances I consider that there is an ongoing risk that any one or more of the above failings could recur.

FOR SEPTPT AND NHS ENGLAND:- The absence of a written record of the \u201cbest practice\u201d forensic pathway referred to by in his evidence, and consideration of whether the transfer of individuals such as Dean to prison is indeed \u201cbest practice\u201d, taking into account the consequent delay in transfer and the suitability of the prison environment for mentally disordered individuals. 3. FOR CARE UK, NOMS, SEPT:- The lack of clarity regarding the hospital transfer process. The evidence at the inquest demonstrated that this is currently shrouded in confusion and contradiction (if the PSI and the NHS England \u201cgood practice\u201d is compared). Given that rationalisation of the process is still a \u201cwork in progress\u201d, the family consider that it should be given urgent consideration. 4. FOR NOMS:- Training regarding the ACCT process. In previous prison deaths and in response to previous PPO reports, promises have been made about training having been provided to staff yet the same mistakes are being repeated. Meaningful action in required in this regard. 5. FOR NHS ENGLAND:- The resilience of psychiatric cover at Chelmsford prison, which would need to be raised with NHS England who commission such services and decide on the budget. 6. FOR NOMS:- The meaningful involvement of families in the ACCT process, including by ensuring the formal recording, and communication of concerns raised by a prisoner\u2019s

The method that Ms Williams later used to take her own life was specifically described to CANDI during the assessment process in January 2016. I am concerned that, although a general risk assessment was undertaken on several occasions, there was no consideration of the specific risk which Ms Williams had previously described. Furthermore, I am concerned that, as it stands, the Trust\u2019s own investigation does not reflect this issue and that the potential for further learning from Ms Williams\u2019 death could be missed. 6 ACTION COULD BE TAKEN In my opinion action could be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the addressee, has the power to take such action. 7 YOUR RESPONSE You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 16 February 2016. I, the coroner, may extend the period. Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed. 8 COPIES and PUBLICATION I have sent a copy of my report to the Chief Coroner, Ms Williams\u2019 family, the Metropolitan Police Service and the Care Quality Commission. I am also under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a copy of your response. The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who he believes may find it useful or of interest. You may make representations to me, the coroner, at the time of your response, about the release or the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner. 9 22 December 2016 Assistant Coroner R

Escort Record 1. The person escort record (PER) and appended report of the forensic medical examiner (FME) that accompanied Mr Kahssay to HMP Pentonville did not accompany him to nurse reception screening. Circumstances of the Index Offence 2. The index offence is recorded on the PER (and inputted onto the prison computer system NOMIS, though not the healthcare computer system SystmOne), but not the circumstances. The circumstances \u2013 perhaps from the indictment read out in court \u2013 may be potentially helpful to healthcare and possibly also to discipline staff in prison. This is not clear cut, because the logistics of obtaining the information and making it available to those who need it are complex; prosecutions must not be compromised; and there is the potential for making a prisoner\u2019s mental state worse by probing the circumstances. However, it seems that this is an issue that is worthy of consideration, preferably at a national level. General Practitioner Records 3. The general practitioner records were never obtained (an issue that I have raised in the past), despite there being a system in place for Pentonville healthcare administrative staff to do this. Whilst that did not impact upon Mr Kahssay\u2019s care, it might for another prisoner. 3 Nurse Reception Screening 4. The first reception screen template contained questions that carried an inherent ambiguity, in that they related to a change in personal and family circumstances, which must always be the case when a person is incarcerated and therefore does not assist in determining which prisoners are at an increased risk. (I did hear at inquest that any prisoner on a charge of murder will now be the subject of a psychiatric assessment.) 5. Both nurses conducting reception screening talked often in evidence about not being able to do anything other than accept the answers given by the prisoner. They did not seem to bring any objective analysis to the screening. The process of nurse screening appeared at times to be a tick box exercise. 6. The second reception (well man) screening nurse did not explore the history of depression recorded, he said because the prison general practitioner had not prescribed any medication for depression. On reflection, the nurse thought that he should have asked about it. Resuscitation 7. The resuscitation led by the two nurses occupying the positions of primary (Hotel 7) and secondary (Hotel 12) leads for emergency healthcare in the prison that night, was significantly lacking in the following ways. \uf0b7 The nurse with primary responsibility for emergency care in the prison did not have a proper understanding of the nature of a code red and a code blue prison medical emergency. (I have raised this issue in the past.) \uf0b7 One minute and twelve seconds elapsed after nurse arrival before any substantive care was given. The action during that one minute and twelve seconds did not appear to progress the resuscitation attempt. \uf0b7 There seemed no clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities during the resuscitation. Of course these may change as those giving resuscitation tire, but the changes seemed haphazard. \uf0b7 There was no checking for breath or airway manoeuvre at the outset or at any time during the resuscitation. \uf0b7 There was no checking for pulse at the outset, before commencing chest compressions, or at any time during the resuscitation. 4 The lead nurse attempted to justify this by saying that she had not wanted to waste time. This was despite the first action upon finding the casualty being to apply a blood pressure cuff, on the basis that this was part of the nurse assessment. \uf0b7 When giving evidence, the lead nurse appeared to conflate the casualty who is in cardiorespiratory arrest with the casualty who is merely unconscious. She repeatedly talked about the need to give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to an unconscious casualty. She said that, at the time she started chest compressions, she did not know whether Mr Kahssay was breathing or not breathing. \uf0b7 When CPR was given, chest compressions were ineffective, being too quick and too shallow. \uf0b7 There was only one brief attempt to use an ambubag, the majority of the resuscitation taking place without airway assistance or with a non rebreathe oxygen mask. \uf0b7 It appeared that one oxygen cylinder was empty, as it had to be changed for another. The nurse leading the resuscitation described it as chaotic. That is indeed how it appeared to me from her description and from viewing the bodycam footage.

The ACCT document was not completed fully, did not accompany Liam around the prison as it should have and not all appropriate individuals were invited to the reviews. Available documentary information was not read or used, and pressures of time were cited to explain these failings. Consideration should be given to formally confirming that all necessary documentation has been considered prior to the ACCT review, and to ensure the Officers and Healthcare staff are aware of their responsibilities. 2 . This ACCT was only open for a short period. It did not serve Liam's needs properly and was closed before any review system picked up the inadequacies. 3 . The Governor provided evidence that resourcing was affecting the ability of officers to carry out their duties regarding keeping prisoners safe from self harm. In this particularly vulnerable population of young men, their safety is paramount and this should be the first consideration.

seriousness of the deceased\u2019s condition was realised whilst the deceased was at HMP Durham although probably initially misdiagnosed. During a hypomanic episode which lasted a number of weeks the deceased was for a time left in a urine soaked cell, drinking and washing from the cell toilet at a time when he needed specialist hospital treatment. The evidence showed that his illness was not properly addressed. At HMP Durham a psychiatric referral for the purpose of compiling a care plan, including a plan for therapeutic medication was never completed and he was transferred to HMP Haverigg without any steps being taken to plan health care for the future, take action to avoid a recurrence of his illness or identify and deal with a relapse should one occur. At HMP Haverigg there was inadequate mental health cover with at times only one mental 1 2 health nurse and no provision for psychiatric referral. He was transferred to HMP Kirkham. A lack of suitable psychiatric care facilities at HMP Kirkham (among other things) led to a transfer to HMP Risley, where due to inadequacies of care planning and communication deficits which had been a feature of the deceased\u2019s care whilst in prison, the fact that the deceased was relapsing into depression was not recognised.

This was not a situation where she needed 24 hour supervision Nevertheless, it would have been helpful for him to know the basis for the leave, because he would then have modified his own behaviour accordingly. 2. The weekend before the weekend of her death, Ms Morris\u2019s partner felt that she had not been well during the weekend leave. I appreciate that care must be taken not to override a patient\u2019s autonomy, but it might be useful for staff routinely to consider whether they are able to obtain feedback from family members after such leave. 3. There appears to be confusion about whether a doctor is needed to authorise unplanned leave of an informal patient (not relevant in this case because the leave had already been authorised). Your serious incident review of this matter indicates that this is necessary, but I heard evidence that such medical authorisation is not routinely sought. 4. Substandard documentation in the nursing records had already been identified before the inquest by your serious incident review.

and the London 1. Whilst it was clear to me from the evidence I heard at inquest that Barts and the London, both in terms of certain individuals within it and as an organisation, took its pastoral responsibilities very seriously indeed and made great efforts to support this student, there was one aspect of their processes that I think would benefit from review. The decision that Ms Chanthirakumar could re-take the fourth year of her medical degree was seen by the medical school as a helpful decision. The re-take was allowed on the basis of her ill health and was not a criticism of her academic achievement. That she would not be able to take her fourth year examinations in August 2015 came to be regarded as almost self evident, because she had not been able to attend the majority of her recent clinical placement and had been so recently so unwell. However, unbeknown to the university staff, Ms Chanthirakumar appears to have lacked some insight at this point, and was actually hoping not to have to re-take the year, but instead to take her fourth year exams in August 2015. 3 Given the very particular course of very recent events leading up to the medical school\u2019s decision, I wonder whether a personal meeting to discuss matters with her could have been arranged, rather than communicating this by email. A face to face meeting may not necessarily have had any impact on the outcome, but nevertheless I think would be a helpful consideration for the process in the future. East London Trust 2. After the medical school was alerted to Ms Chanthirakumar\u2019s illness by two of her friends on 17 June 2015, a senior lecturer working in student support services (and, as it happens, herself a general practitioner) rang Globe Ward of Mile End Hospital and spoke to a treating nurse. Her intention in making this call was to deliver information, most specifically to relay concerns that Ms Chanthirakumar was not being wholly open with staff about the extent of her distress. However, such was the ward nurse\u2019s anxiety not to breach patient confidentiality, the conversation was not as meaningful or as productive as it might otherwise have been. It seems to me that nurses and doctors working in mental health particularly, would benefit from a reminder of the difference between absorbing (and, if appropriate, acting upon) concerns raised by a patient\u2019s relatives, friends, tutors etc., and divulging a patient\u2019s private details. In addition, it may well be that a piece of self reflection has already been undertaken by the mental health team caring for Ms Chanthirakumar, taking into account the fact that she took her own life so soon after her discharge from a period of inpatient treatment, and with her university being unaware of her own expectation that she would be able to take her exams in August 2015.

Piotr Kucharz was a Polish gentleman who commenced living in the United Kingdom in April 2014. At the time he sought to strangle himself with a cord he was an informal patient at the Conway Ward at Parkwood, a mental health facility in Blackpool. At his inquest, evidence was heard from a number of members of staff as regards what constitutes an effective observation. He was the subject of what were described as Safety and Security [SAS] and general observations the completion of which was the responsibility of a number of members of care staff. The evidence heard from staff raised an area of concern because that evidence indicated quite clearly that there was a lack of consistency and clarity as regards what constitutes an effective observation. An independent expert witness indicated in a report that he completed prior to the inquest that he felt custom and practice was such that some staff were merely checking on the \u201cwhereabouts\u201d of the patient. Some staff felt that they were expected to enter the room of the patient and to try to engage with him and to check the room environment for anything that may pose a risk to him. Others felt that whether they were expected to actually enter a patient\u2019s room to conduct the observation could vary depending on the level of risk a particular patient presented, in other words that they felt they had an element of discretion as regards whether they entered the room. This evidence appeared to be in contrast to a Trust policy. In the case of Piotr Kucharz, as can be seen above he had limited understanding of English, and a number of staff gave evidence that he remained in his room throughout his time on the Conway Ward and did not wish to engage with them. Nevertheless, the author of the Trust\u2019s Sudden Untoward Incident Review document agreed that there was no such discretion and that staff ought to enter the room to complete and effective observation. At the conclusion to the inquest I expressed the view that I was concerned that there is a risk of future deaths because staff remain unclear about what amounts to an effective observation, and more specifically whether there are circumstances which may allow them to refrain from verbally engaging with a patient, or from physically entering a patient\u2019s room to check the environment, and that should that lack of consistency and clarity prevail, other patients may be placed at risk as a result of inadequate observations. 2 3 For the avoidance of doubt, I confirm that I am of the opinion that the above concern remains valid despite the fact that further to Piotr Kucharz\u2019s death the provision of mental health care for patient\u2019s such as Piotr has moved from the Conway Ward at

and Islington Trust 1. It seemed from the evidence I heard that the Camden and Islington Trust psychiatry liaison team (doctor and nurse) operating at Whittington Hospital on the night of 15 November 2015, were not wholly clear about the protocols for receipt of information from police officers bringing patients into hospital on a voluntary basis. 2. The team then saw a patient without waiting to obtain the triage record created by Whittington Hospital Trust staff. 3. The doctor did not ask Ms Martin about thoughts of suicide within the context of her earlier declaration that she would die that night. 4. He did not ask her about any thoughts of harming another person, regardless of the fact he was not aware that she had threatened this. 5. He did not address his mind to what had led up to the police being called for Ms Martin, nor who had called them. 3 6. Neither doctor nor nurse obtained a collateral history of events from a family member before concluding their interview with Ms Martin. 7. When they obtained this afterwards and then realised that Ms Martin had left the hospital, they contacted the police but did not characterise this as an emergency. 8. The crisis team did not pass on information received from Ms Martin\u2019s sister to the psychiatry liaison team with a sufficient degree of urgency to ensure that this was taken into consideration before the interview with Ms Martin was concluded. Whittington Hospital Trust 1. There seemed to be some degree of confusion surrounding the voluntary attendance of a patient with mental health needs accompanied by the police, that suggests a multi agency discussion and agreement would be beneficial. 2. I was told at inquest by Camden & Islington that the Whittington had been unable to locate the Whittington triage record of Ms Martin\u2019s attendance, and I did not discover any record of the call made by Ms Martin\u2019s sister to the emergency department that night. Metropolitan Police Service 1. The police call handler who spoke to Ms Martin did not record that she said: \u201cI need to jump a balcony\u201d. This was important information. 2.

- ANTI-LIGATURE STRIPS ON CELL DOORS 1. The deceased was a design engineer and his sketches found after death in his cell set out diagrammatically how he deduced that the gap between the cell door and frame would allow a ligature to be threaded through and that a wedge could be created with paper pamphlets to prevent slippage of the ligature. 2. The risk of cell doors being used for ligature points is well known. In HMP Dovegate alone some years ago, there were 3 suicides close in time where the upper hinge was used as a ligature point. 3. However, whilst the current specification for cell door design now incorporates an anti- ligature strip, there is no retrofit programme in operation and thus, there are significant numbers of cell doors that do not meet the current standard. 4. The need to eradicate ligature points in cells has been the subject of recommendations in PPO reports in Northern Ireland (JOHN MARTIN GERARD KENNEWAY published 10.12 2009 at recommendation 10 and COLIN MARTIN BELL published 9.1.2009 at recommendation 9) and many Australian Coronial decisions and observations of Coroners in England and Wales in the old Rule 43 and the new Regulation 28 reports. 5. Further, this was the subject of detailed commentary in the paper produced by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science (University College London) where it was recognised as being of paramount importance that there be removal of as many ligature points as possible in cells and that remedial action would need to be taken as quickly as possible before a new method spreads within and between establishments. 6. Evidence was given that the cost of a national retrofit programme for all doors being adapted with an anti-ligature strip to meet the new design would be a significant proportion of the current budget. However, given the particular vulnerability of prisoners on induction and remand wings, a retrofit of those cells doors on such wings not meeting the requirement would provide some protection and would be a measured response to those prisoners who are known to be at heightened risk. NOMS\/SODEXO \u2013 THE ACCT PROCESS 7. PSI 64\/2011 and the Quick Time Learning Bulletin (issue 12 august 2012) which clarified opening an ACCT was the subject of much scrutiny. There seems to be no national pro forma document to guide staff through the process and document the decision making. By contrast, the Act 2 Care risk assessment in the Scottish prison system does provide a structured approach. A pro forma regime would have the 33 Thorpe Road, Peterborough, PE3 6AB Tel 01733 452275 | Fax 0870 238 4085 advantage of providing an audit trail and can be reviewed for training purposes if shortcomings emerge. 8. There appears to be on occasions an over reliance on assessment of current risk as emphasised in the QTLB of 2012 by considering demeanour and presentation at the reception stage. The PPO bulletin of March 2015 highlights deficiencies in this approach. There are known risk factors for suicide and self-harm and active identification of relevant risk factors from documentation and information (e.g. SASH forms and PERs and medical records and an FME report) should be fully considered and balanced against apparent mood so that the there is a comprehensive risk assessment.. A pro forma document could record what factors and documentation have been considered and the reasons for the decision. 9. It is known that a prisoners risk of self-harm and\/or suicide may increase in certain circumstances. This applied to the deceased in this inquest. HMP Gartree have identified measures to identify potential triggers and there has been developed a database on trigger dates but only for those who are or have been subject to an ACCT. This could be refined to deal with re assessment of risk for many prisoners if key factors exist. (See Equality and Human Rights Commission paper in 2015 on Preventing Deaths in detention of adults with Mental Health Conditions). Again, the PPO bulletin of March 2015 highlighted increased vulnerability where a restraining order was made and this could be input into a database to prompt a review of risk. The deceased was served with papers concerning harassment whilst on remand that may have emphasised that his marriage was over and therefore increased vulnerability particularly when bail was subsequently refused and victim impact statements were referred to in court. 10. The PPO report recommended that an ACCT should be opened whenever a prisoner has recently self - harmed or expressed suicidal intent. NOMS \u2013 HEALTHCARE SCREENING. 11. The healthcare screening which is a question and answer discussion based on specifically designed questions is prescriptive. It makes no mention of s.136 detentions which would be a clear indicator of enhanced risk and the deceased had two such detentions. SODEXO - ITEMS USED TO FACILITATE SUICIDE 12. Some prisoners at HMP Peterborough are allowed to carry their cell door key which is placed on shoelaces tied together and placed around the neck of the prisoner which clearly creates a self-made ligature for those who may be at risk. 13. In addition, the deceased referred to experimentation by suffocation in his diary by putting a plastic bag over his head and some cells are known to have plastic removable bin liners which can be used
